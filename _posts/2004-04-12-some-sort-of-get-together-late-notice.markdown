title: Some sort of get-together, late notice.
excerpt: |
  Well, since it is my birthday today, I am going out to dinner with a few friends at <a href="http://twincities.citysearch.com/profile?id=5588075">Annie's Parlour</a> on the U of M campus.   Anyone who can read this is welcome to show up.   It's kind of late notice I guess.   EDIT:  Being the doof that I am, I forgot to put the time in the original post.  We're meeting around 6:30, although we may be a little late or a little early.
  
  Mmmm.. yummy big burgers with fries and a malt.  My mouth is watering already.
