Get more exercise and eat the same as you did before, and you will lose weight.  This has to be true, based simply on physics.  Back when I was using the <a href="http://base0.net/archives/183-The-monthly-diet-report.html">Hacker's Diet</a>, it worked like a charm.  Then it was all about eating less calories, because I wasn't really keen on doing exercise in my olden days.  It worked for a while.  Unfortunately I got stressed and stopped countign calories, and weighing every day.  I've started the weighing again, and maybe I can actually fire up gnuplot again and produce some pretty graphs like the one on the left.

I've had an iPod for approximately 5 years now.  That puts me a bit ahead of the curve.  I still remember seeing the <a title="YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7ve8LxTpXQ">original iPod commercial</a>, and looking literally seconds later for how much it was, and seeing how much I could sell my old player on eBay for.  Having been in the mp3 scene for a while at that point, I knew that it would turn everything on it's head.  I got it and replaced my normal player for walking to and from class and listening while coding.  Now I have a new iPod video, and it is the chief entertainment while I'm in the exercise room.  At first I was just listening to my fairly large music collection.  Then I started listening to podcasts again - they are about the right length, and I enjoyed them.  Now I've harnessed the power of the video iPod to kill two birds with one stone:  I'm watching my large collection of Anime at an hour a day.  This means about 3 episodes if I skip the openings and endings.  I also watch Heroes on Tuesday nights, after I transfer it from the TiVo.  The only problem I'm having with this setup is that the screen is small, so I need to hold it fairly close to my face in order to read the subtitles.

Today marks one month on the diet and exercise regimen.  I started on the scale at 344 and this week's average was 337, 7 pounds lighter.  I'm going a little slower than my goal of 2 pounds per week, but I seem to be hitting the right buttons at least.

This week (Nov 10 - Nov 16):
Minimum: 335.5 (-2.5) (Nov 14)
Maximum: 339.5 (-0.5) (Nov 16)
Average: 337.2 (-2.05) (137.2 to goal)
Exercise Calories: 2563 on 5 days
Average Calories per session:  512.16
