Monday is a fairly quiet day for me at school, so I decided to waste a ton of time making <a href="http://jamuraa.livejournal.com">my journal</a> look like <a href="http://www.base0.net/">my homepage</a>, in the hopes of merging them into one this weekend.  If only I could get the <a href="http://jamuraa.livejournal.com/3910.html">comments pages</a> to look right.   I'm willing to let basically anyone use this new style that I made (I actually modified "A sturdy gesture" heavily).  All in all, I'm pretty happy with the new page.  I have a couple things that I still want to fix, like putting a navigation link at the bottom of the page, and some more links to facilitate things like editing entries.

Monday night I went to <a href="http://amagadalyn.livejournal.com">amagadalyn</a>'s place and we watched
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097814/">Kiki's Delivery Service</a>. It was her first time watching it, and my first time watching it in english.  I was happy with the way that Kirsten Dunst played Kiki.   I brought over <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092067/">Laputa</a> as well, so we'll probably watch it sometime.  I think it's a bit better than Kiki, and she seemed to like that, so I have high hopes.  We're definitely watching it in japanese in order to avoid James Van Der Beek's voice acting.

Tuesday was "change Amy night" - she got a haircut and decided to get a labret piercing.  I was thrilled to go along and kinda wanted to watch, but it happened kinda fast and I was guarding her stuff.  It looks really great on her - I'm sure she'll post pics as soon as her camera works again.

Yesterday I actually attempted to get some work done on the iPaq interface to the robots, but discovered that the one that I needed to work on was completely discharged of all of it's battery power.  We discovered some adapters that seem to work for charging them - I hope that when I get in today I can attempt to get some work dona again.

Last night we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168629/">Dancer in the Dark</a>, which was an excellent movie with a shooting style I found very interesting (although at the theater it could have been nauseating).   It had camera movement which seemed very similar to a home-movie type thing.   As for the content of the movie, it was very sad - it had a melancholy feeling from the start, and didn't really get any happier from there.  Probably the most serious musical-type movie I've seen in a while - and Bjork's musical style was perfect for this movie.

Today is another long thursday, and I need to do my homework for tomorrow and grade about 10 more labs that got emailed to me last night.  I've also forgotten my lunch at home.  Statistics lab is a great time to update my LJ.  I've been very forward-looking lately, and have a desire to actually get things done at work.  I've decided that I don't really go to sleep in class because I'm sleepy, but more because I have a general tired-ness going on and I get bored at the content of the classes I'm going to.  I've stopped reading for both of my classes in hopes that I get interested when the material is actually new to me.  Oops, class is over already.
