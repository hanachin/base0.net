title: The monthly diet report
excerpt: |-
  Well, I put in my month's weight, and I don't seem to be making any progress.. <a href="http://www.base0.net/diet/012004.png">See for yourself</a>.  The <a href="http://www.base0.net/diet/dietgraph.png">overall progress</a> looks a lot better than the monthly one.  My goal for February: 10 pounds loss.
  
  For those that don't know (well, that would be pretty much everyone, I think) , I'm attempting to follow the <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html">Hacker's Diet</a> which seems very down-to-earth to me: it's basically a calorie counter.

Having the book free online probably influenced my decision a little.
