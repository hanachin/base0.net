Dear bike-stealers of last summer,

You took my bike.  I liked my bike.  Now that spring has come again, I want it back.  I want to bike along forested areas and beside lakes in the great city that I have moved to.  I want to be able to travel miles from my home and the worries of modern life to read a book in a cool breeze.  I want to eat great picnics with <a href="http://amagdalyn.livejournal.com">amagdalyn</a> on grassy hills in the bright warming sunlight.  Look out your window and see the beautiful spring weather.  I hope you're looking from a cell.

Hatefully yours,
