This weekend was the first time in a few years that I have done anything on Valentine's day.  It was my busiest and best ever, I think.

We had a lab meeting on saturday about the new scout user interface as a check to see where we are on the project.  I think it's turning out really good, as someone who is mostly sitting on the sidelines helping out when I can.  I wish I could put more work in on the project, but I think we'll run into a "too many cooks" problem before long.

Amy came to the lab and we had lunch at Sally's and played some pool with <a href="http://silvrayn.livejournal.com">silvrayn</a>, <a href="http://want_a_be.livejournal.com">want_a_be</a>, Chuck and Andi.  Afterward there was yummy ice cream at Ben and Jerry's.   Amy and I still had about an hour to kill, so we went and played some more pool in <a href="http://www.coffman.umn.edu/goldys/">Goldy's Game Room</a>.

Then we went to The Vagina Monologues.  The show was actually much better than my preconceptions placed it.  There were a lot of funny stories with a smattering of very serious facts and touching stories.  It was well done, I'd recommend it to anyone (even the guys).

Sunday was the party at <a href="http://kitchenwitch.livejournal.com">kitchenwitch</a>'s place.  Lots of new people met.  We ended up playing a bunch of games of <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Fluxx/Default.html">Fluxx</a> (which reminded me that I want to buy a set of <a href="http://wunderland.com/icehouse/Default.html">IceHouse</a>) while a rousing game of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000IWCY/002-7753593-4996068">Clue</a> was played in the other part of the room.  It was certainly a fun time.

The web servers are down here at school today, so my office hours are quieter than I thought they would be.  Maybe I can get some work done later today.
