It's been a good month of exercise, and I've been doing pretty good on
my goals that I have laid out for the year.  The scale has been
frustratingly un-helping this month though, and done some ups and
downs.  I have also devised a schedule to keep my running a little more
exciting.  The most frustrating part of the diet and exercise this
month has been the diet part.  Let's start with the charts.

The last thirty days can highlight my frustration with my weight over
the last month or so.  This graph has far more red areas than I am
comfortable with.  It seems like my weight is still on the downward
trend, which is good at least.   My daily deficit from this graph is
about 300 calories less than I am aiming for, but it isn't a big
surprise.

The year to date graph looks better.  There were a lot of gains in the
first month of the year which make the whole year not look so bad.
I've been a little more lax on my diet in the last month.  I don't
watch the calories as much as I used to when I go out to eat, and
sometimes have days when I overeat by a ton because I am eating lots
of empty calories like chips and sweets.

I've found for a while that eating too many carbs just makes me
hungrier later in the day, and makes me want to eat more again.  This
is probably some of the reason why a low-carb diet worked so well for
me last year, and makes me want to start adding a significant amount
of protein back into my diet, especially at the beginning of the day
when it will have the most impact.

Recently I have been having a meal at about 4pm, which does some kind
of substitute for a lunch meal which I usually skip.   I really like
to work at my job straight through the day so that I can get a full
day in without having to take time off for lunch, and also get in
fairly early.  Having a meal right when I get home helps me get
through the three or four hours of structured work that I have at home
before a real meal, usually something wonderful cooked by my partner
or a nice meal out.

Usually this mid-day meal is carb-packed because it's the most
efficient way to get a decent number of calories into me.  I usually
don't want to spend a ton of time before I start cranking on some
actual work and the exercise schedule.

Speaking of the exercise schedule, I've been pretty happy with the
progress since the last report.  By [running graph][1] shows the
miles that I've run, and can lead you to all of the miles that I've
done.  The swath on the graph also makes it clear that I will handily
make the one hundred miles a month goal that I have planned for the
year.  I've already got far enough ahead that if something kept me
from exercising, I would be okay skipping a couple of days.  According
to my [dailymile stats][2], I've almost ran 1000 miles since I started
tracking it as well.  That is a pretty nice accomplishment.

I'm starting to spice up my running schedule with the new workout type
that I laid out in the last month's report.  The pacing runs, I've
found, are good for my confidence, and hopefully will help in the long
run to nudge me toward running a longer time without stopping.
I'm toying with the idea of running a half marathon without stopping
sometime in the future, and I definitely can't do that if I keep
running at my natural pace, which I end up tiring myself out too much.

In order to incorporate them into my workout, I've started replacing
some of my interval runs with some of them throughout a month of
workouts.  My schedule is a little complicated now - it doesn't follow
a set schedule as much as it used to before.  I run on the "training
schedule" on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, which consists of three
interval runs followed by a pacing run, that I end up repeating.
Because this is four slots for three days in the week, I only repeat
the schedule every four weeks.  

On Thursdays, I run "As You Like"
days, where I run the course around the park, and run whenever I feel
like it.  Lately that has been meaning that I run longer distances
than I would on my normal interval run, and have variable speeds.
Usually it's not faster than the interval run days, but [one of
them][3]
is still in my top five fastest.  Sundays are still the one day between
two training days, so they are a dedicated walking day.

This schedule ends up being regular enough, and spiced enough because
I'm not always doing the same day for the pacing day every week.  I'm
hoping that I can still have some gains in the next months like I had
earlier when I first started running.  It's still a lot of fun to run
though, which is a good sign.  I still haven't talked about staying
warm, but there hasn't been as much need in the last month, with
more forty degree days.  Maybe next month.
