title: I can work overtime I can work in a mine
excerpt: |-
  Labor day weekend approacheth, and myself and [lj user="ceilingsarecool"] have secured a little getaway for ourselves.  It is proving to be a nice way to relax a while before a big rush of work.  I have been in all true form not updating the blog lately, so I get to give everyone a big update all at once.
  
  The iBook problems which I mentioned in the <a href="http://base0.net/archives/217-Late-at-night-when-the-wires-in-the-walls.html">last blog entry</a> proved to be fatal to the machine, so I went out and bought a shiny new MacBook to replace it.

Labor day weekend approacheth, and myself and [lj user="ceilingsarecool"] have secured a little getaway for ourselves.  It is proving to be a nice way to relax a while before a big rush of work.  I have been in all true form not updating the blog lately, so I get to give everyone a big update all at once.

The iBook problems which I mentioned in the <a href="http://base0.net/archives/217-Late-at-night-when-the-wires-in-the-walls.html">last blog entry</a> proved to be fatal to the machine, so I went out and bought a shiny new MacBook to replace it.  Given the pricing behind most of the small laptops and the experience that I had with my iBook, I was happy with my decision.  I plan to add ram (Apple's ram is so expensive) and replace the hard drive (also cheaper elsewhere) sometime before the end of the year.  After I bought the new book, looking through my old receipts I discovered that my iBook is still under AppleCare so I took it in to get it fixed.   The Genius Bar at the MOA store was very busy today so we had to walk around the mall and then wait for ages still.  However, we successfully got the thing to freeze twice in the presence of a MacGenius(tm) so it is now off to the magic depot in the sky for fixing before I sell it used to someone.  It is a nice machine and works great other than the freezing which will be fixed, and I was informed by the MacGenius(tm) that the AppleCare travels with the machine, so if it breaks in the next 8 months or so the buyer can get it fixed for free.

Honeywell this week was pretty hectic and non-normal.  There was a deadline which required the working of an application I hadn't planned on having working until the end of the week, so I had to work Monday and Tuesday, putting in 20 hours before mid-week.  This made it slightly hard to get anything else done, but still not bad because it means I have a little leeway for next week.  The good news is that we got it done, and the even better news is that it's possible to focus on other things which I have more experience in there now.

After the weekend (which I'm sure we'll have pictures from) is the start of the new school year.  This means that my schedule is being impacted a lot, and I will need to get used to classes again.  With any luck, this semester will be the last time I ever take classes in grad school.  I also need to start a paper next week which is due on the 14th, so it's a little tight on the scheduling end.  Hopefully I will be able to pull it off, because the conference is in Italy next year and [lj user="ceilingsarecool"] has a keen interest in going with me.

But for now, I get a little R&amp;R time before rejoining previously scheduled overwhelming work, already in progress.
