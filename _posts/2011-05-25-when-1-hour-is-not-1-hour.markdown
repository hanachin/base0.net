One of the reasons that I'm [waking up earlier][2] nowadays is because
I can take my commute an hour earlier.  I get up at about 4:30, then
finish all my prep in an hour, so that I can be on the road by 5:40 at
the latest.  This means that I'm using the highway much earlier than
the rest of the population.  There are still a decent number of cars
on the road, but it makes the drive easier.

This week I also discovered that it cuts my commute time for the day
by at least one third.  I woke up an hour later than normal, because
for some reason my alarm wasn't going off that day.  I thought I would
just do everything an hour later in the day and everything was going
good up until I got onto the highway at 6:40.  Suddenly there was a
lot of traffic on the road, and all of the congestion traffic controls
were in effect.  It lengthened my commute from a normal 20 minutes to
35, and made me even later than I was in the first place.

An hour later in the morning is 75 minutes.  It put my whole day back
even farther than normal.  I ended up taking an early day because
I know that on the other direction it's also at least 15 minutes more
when I have left late because I was busy at work, sometimes it's even
as long as double.  Suddenly my day would be 23 hours.

With the [amount of time I have][3], I am making sure for as long as
I can that I will be up on time.  Of course, the ideal commute might
be from the bedroom three steps to the office - at some point I might
want to try that once a week.  There are other advantages to going
into the office though, especially at my work where there is a whole
lab of equipment needed sometimes.
