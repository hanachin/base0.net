title: The Temple of Laziness
excerpt: |-
  I request an audience in the chamber, and I get informed it is my turn.  Others may join me, or may be in the chamber already.  I enter, make a request, and wait, head raised, staring at the icon above me.  The icon moves and suddenly I feel light or heavy.  The room is adorned with shiny objects, some reflecting my own image back to me while I stand and think.  When I am ready, I exit the room.  I have been moved by experience there.
  
  Many perform rituals every day.  Do they mean anything?
