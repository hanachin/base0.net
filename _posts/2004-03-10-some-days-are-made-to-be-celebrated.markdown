title: Some days are made to be celebrated.
excerpt: "I went to get chinese for lunch today and got the fortune: \"Pleasant days lie ahead\" or some such.   Strangely, I just aced an exam I did almost no preparation for, got a call from <a href=\"http://amagdalyn.livejournal.com\">amagdalyn</a> with very happy news (which I'm sure she'll extole upon you later), and am the recipient of a free iTunes song in my first bottle of Pepsi in a long time.  To top it off, I have only a small pile of work and have actually been productive already today.  I feel like going out and having a beer to celebrate the good fortune."
