From
[lizards](http://base0.net/posts/big-bang-theory-intro-7-iguanas-basking)
last week to the big lizards this week.  These are the
peacable kind, well, as peacable as you can expect from a gigantic lizard.

I spent a little bit of time looking but I couldn't turn up the source
image on any of the normal sites (or any of the new ones that I found
to sift through either).  It's probably not original though, it looks
like a drawing of some kind or a painting.  It might be one from a
museum like the one at [Dinosaur National
Monument](http://www.nps.gov/dino/index.htm) where they have found
some other bones as well.

This particular type of giant lizard is called an
[Apatosaurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatosaurus) now, although
I learned it as Brontosaurus when I was growing up.  They lived in the
Late Jurassic period, making the ~7000BC way off the mark of course by
about 140 million years.  Lots of these are in big museums, or
replicas, with their heads craning upwards kind of like a giraffe, but
recently people have been saying that they would never be in that
position, because it would be impossible for the circulatory system to
pump the blood to the head when it was up - they would put it at the
max horizontal from the center.

I remember seeing a lot of these on the side of the road in the past,
next to Sinclair stations where you could get gas.  I always thought
that it was a cruel tip to the ultimate source of the oil that you
were buying.  They are legitimate [roadside
attractions](http://www.agilitynut.com/dinos/sinclair.html) and I'm
pretty sure that I've had my picture taken to them some time before.
