Today we come upon our first picture in the montage which doesn't have a lifeform in it.  It's lava!  Dynamic!  BOOM!  Eruption!

This particular image is kindof hard to make out in the black and white which it was modified into to make it look old.  The <a href="http://www.jupiterimages.com/popup2.aspx?popup2=i&amp;navigationSubType=itemdetails&amp;related=n&amp;itemID=23083579">original</a> is a little easier to see the actual lava which is flowing from an eruption happening in the center to another pool of lava rock.

There are four different types of lava, which are based on the chemical composition of the lava itself, but that correlates with the temperature.  It is of course, extremely hot, with the coolest form of lava being at least 1000 degrees Fahrenheit.   A lot of the lava which is in the US is in Hawaii - it would be nifty to see some of it, but hopefully not the quick flowing kind.  We're heading there on our honeymoon later this year, so it's a possibility.   One of the things that has always fascinated me is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow_lava">Pillow lava</a>, which is when lava is extruded under water and instantly cools and solidifies partially.  It also looks <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8fpvgLTJhg">really cool</a>.  I found out that it is also used as a way-up criterion because of the way it is formed with the ridges normally on the top.
