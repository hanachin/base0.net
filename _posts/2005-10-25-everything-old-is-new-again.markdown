Well, I've switched blog software.  <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> is great, but recently I've been wanting to develop more things to put on the page, and the model that <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">drupal</a> uses is much easier to handle and seems much more flexible.  The developers seem to have much more open source mindset - I don't know why, it's just a perception thing.  It gives me much more control over which articles which go to different syndication places, like the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jamuraa_rss/">LiveJournal feed</a> and <a href="http://planet.debian.org">Planet Debian</a>. Drupal also makes it much easier for users to setup their own feeds for categories, if some people are only interested in say, the <a href="/reviews/book">book</a> or <a href="/reviews/movie">movie</a> reviews.

I also made a new theme which is pretty minimal.  I'm hoping to add more features in the near future.  A short list, which is probably not comprehensive:
<ul>
	<li> Book Reading/Review Sidebar</li>
	<li> Movie Review Sidebar</li>
	<li> A little color, possibly some icons</li>
	<li> Revamp the TrainSched page</li>
</ul>
