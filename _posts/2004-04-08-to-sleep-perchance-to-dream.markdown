I feel like I've just been just going through the motions of life lately.  Get homework done, watch anime, work on some Debian packages, chat a little, sleep.   Today is another Thursday I know will feel way longer than it really will be.

Sunday I went to see <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/hellboy/">Hellboy</a>.  It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't good either.   It had a terrific setup (the part before the opening sequence was excellent), but fell flat later.  More variety in the enemies would have been nice.  I understand that the director/writer was trying to be true to the actual comics though.

We had a decent Steganography talk on Monday.  I hope that <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~hopper/">he</a> gets hired - he really knows how to present information well, I think he would be a good professor simply for teaching.

I skipped a meeting with a couple of CEO candidates Tuesday because I just didn't feel like getting up.  Apparently some excitement happened while it was going on - people showed up who we weren't really interested in seeing the robots (we've had a bad past with them).  Went out Tuesday night to the Edina grill with <a href="http://silvrayn.livejournal.com">silvrayn</a> and the LJ-silent <a href="http://want_a_be.livejournal.com">want_a_be</a>, with yummy french-toasty pound cake for dessert.

Wednesday was entirely a working on code day, although I didn't get as much done as I wanted to.  I got hungry halfway through the day so I went and grabbed some Nutty Bars from the little convenience store in Coffman.  Later went to Vescios for dinner, which was very good.

Lately I feel like I want to sleep a lot.  Maybe this weekend I will be able to satisfy that.  Class is coming up now, so I better wrap this up.
