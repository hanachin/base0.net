I have a serious interest in electric vehicles.  I pretty much read
anything that goes across my RSS reader about the subject, and am
fairly convinced that when I have the wherewithal, I will be getting
an electric vehicle at some point.  I understand that they are
somewhat controversial about how much waste they create due to their
batteries, I think that using the same energy for everything will
eventually bow to the economies of scale.  I've had a couple of
interesting things that I've been thinking relating to electric
vehicles lately.

The first is me trying to estimate how much money that the United
States Postal Service would save by replacing all of it's neighborhood
trucks with electric vehicles.  I think of this whenever I see one of
those tiny trucks that are filled with mail and seem to stop about
every thirty feet in order to deliver the mail.  It seems like having
these use gasoline is a big waste.  They are basically the ideal
vehicle for electrifying - they are forced to be the most stop-and-go
because they need to stop at every mailbox.  Gasoline or Diesel
engines would need to stay on at these very short stops, but no
electricity would be used for these.  They are always refueled
at the post office that they are based at and usually have routes that
are shorter than 40 miles in total.  That means that they wouldn't
have any problem recharging and that they would not have an issue with
range.  The vehicles are owned by the postal service, so they have the
say on replacing every one of them, which they can roll out slowly if
it has a large up-front cost.

The second is a startup idea, which would be good for the current
climate.  Because electricity is available everywhere, it effectively
democratizes the supply of fuel for these vehicles.  Electricity is
available pretty much everywhere, but people willing to let you
recharge your electric vehicle are not everywhere.  It would be fairly
easy to put a meter on your charger, and then let anyone who is within
a certain range recharge their vehicle using your electricity.   Using
some type of phone application which determined what places within
your range were available, and they could also connect with the meters
in order to automatically transfer the money.  This would solve the
"drive and dash" problem that some gas stations would have.  I would
be interested in how people end up pricing the premium over the
electricity.

I'm excited to see what electric vehicles will do to change the
way transportation works.
