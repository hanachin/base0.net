I've decided that I am going to ditch my cell phone in favor of a cheaper VoIP solution.    This requires me to change phone numbers unfortunately.  If you have my old cell phone number and need my new number, I give you one of two options:
<ul>
	<li> email or IM me</li>
	<li>Call my old number before Wednesday, May 25</li>
</ul>
