I've been reading <a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Planet Debian</a> and noticed <a href="http://planetwatson.co.uk/blog/2011/01/10/new-photo-challenge/">David Watson</a>, <a href="http://blog.cihar.com/archives/2011/01/10/photo-week-1/">Michal Čihař</a> and <a href="http://www.die-welt.net/2011/01/project-52-im-in/">Evgeni Golov</a> are all doing a thing called Project 52.   I've been trying to get myself to do something like <a href="http://365project.org/">365 project</a> for a while now, but I have failed every time I tried to start.  Well, one picture a week seems a bit more reasonable to me, so I'm throwing in as well.  Here's the first two weeks of pictures.  I took them on the weeks I was supposed to, but I just haven't gotten around to posting on the blog yet.

Week 1

<a rel="photo" href="/images/project52/01-wires_and_sensors.jpg">
<img title="Week 1: Wires and Sensors" src="/images/project52/01-wires_and_sensors-postsize.jpg" />
</a>

Week 2

<a rel="photo" href="/images/project52/02-veggies.jpg">
<img title="Week 2: Veggies" src="/images/project52/02-veggies-postsize.jpg" />
</a>

I'll be posting every week.  Should be fun.
