I've been reading <a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Planet Debian</a> and noticed <a href="http://planetwatson.co.uk/blog/2011/01/10/new-photo-challenge/">David Watson</a>, <a href="http://blog.cihar.com/archives/2011/01/10/photo-week-1/">Michal Čihař</a> and <a href="http://www.die-welt.net/2011/01/project-52-im-in/">Evgeni Golov</a> are all doing a thing called Project 52.   I've been trying to get myself to do something like <a href="http://365project.org/">365 project</a> for a while now, but I have failed every time I tried to start.  Well, one picture a week seems a bit more reasonable to me, so I'm throwing in as well.  Here's the first two weeks of pictures.  I took them on the weeks I was supposed to, but I just haven't gotten around to posting on the blog yet.

Week 1

<a rel="attachment wp-att-740" href="http://base0.net/posts/project-52-first-two-weeks/samsung-4/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-740" title="Week 1: Wires and Sensors" src="http://base0.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2011-01-04-12.32.19-610x457.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="457" /></a>

Week 2

<a rel="attachment wp-att-739" href="http://base0.net/posts/project-52-first-two-weeks/samsung-3/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-739" title="Week 2: Veggies" src="http://base0.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2011-01-14-13.19.06-e1295323333609-610x457.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="457" /></a>

I'll be posting every week.  Should be fun.
