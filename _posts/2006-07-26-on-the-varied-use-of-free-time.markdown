Three things which I do with my free time which will have some impact or change this week: Gaming, Sleeping, Watching TV.

In gaming, I discovered a <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/8323">list of games</a> which are available on computer and have AI opponents.  This will probably kill some productivity as it means I discovered <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/8217">San Juan</a>, a card game which I simply must buy a real life copy of.  The game dynamics are perfect and it's in the "learn once, play forever" category.  Hope to play this at the next board gaming night.

In sleep, I am attempting to change my sleeping patterns so that I am an early riser.  Generally I'm a late sleeper and late riser, but as I get older, I am finding that it is better to wake up early and get things done in the morning.  I feel much more productive at the end of the day.  To this end I am now sleeping at 10-11pm. <img class="alignnone" src="http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="" width="17" height="17" /><strong><a href="http://ceilingsarecool.livejournal.com">ceilingsarecool</a></strong> also appreciates the new schedule because it lines up with hers much better.

In TV, I have concocted a plan to lessen the amount of TV that I watch per week.  I have dubbed it the <strong>TiVo TV diet</strong>, and details are after the fold.
