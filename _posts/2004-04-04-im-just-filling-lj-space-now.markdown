<strong>I Am A:</strong> Neutral Good Elf Mage Bard


<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alignment:</span>
<strong>Neutral Good</strong> characters believe in the power of good above all else. They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered 'normal'.


<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Race:</span>
<strong>Elves</strong> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.


<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary Class:</span>
<strong>Mages</strong> harness the magical energies for their own use. Spells, spell books, and long hours in the library are their loves. While often not physically strong, their mental talents can make up for this.


<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secondary Class:</span>
<strong>Bards</strong> are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.


<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deity:</span>
<strong>Mystra</strong> is the Neutral Good goddess of magic. She is also known as the Lady of Mysteries. Followers of Mystra wear armor and carry shields with her symbol on them. Mystra's symbol is a ring of stars.
