We're taking a short siesta here on our last full day in Paris, so I
will post the day before the last day now, and then write up the last
day later this evening.  I'll probably have some time to write a
retrospective of the whole trip on the plane.  It was a day mostly
filled with seeing the sights as they are more traditionally done in
Paris.

Each day that we're here we take in more of the city and we get just a
little more tired, so the day's plans get less and less full as the
vacation goes along.  It's probably better that way anyway.  Our goal
this day was to see the Eiffel Tower, and the Arc de Triomphe, and
possibly go up some of them, then I had my sights set on making the
Museum pass worth the money by visiting the l'Orangerie and seeing
what we could of the rest of the Louvre.  Now that I think about it,
it was a pretty full trip.

We started the day around 10h again, which has been completely fine by
me because I am staying reading up until late in the night lately.
Our first stop was [Breakfast in America][1], which is a restaurant
which is set up like an American cafe and serves breakfast all day
long.  I don't know if it was some weird version of homesickness, but
it was actually pretty nice to sit down to an American-style breakfast
for a while.  The menu was even laminated just like a cafe in the
states, and the waitresses and staff talked in English most of the
time.  I guess it works.  We went to the one on Rive Gauche because it
was just a short walk from the hotel.  I had a cheddar and ham omelet
that I swear was more delicious.  I think that all the food here in
Paris has just been great for some reason.

We walked toward the metro and tried to stop at a magic shop on the
way, but it was closed, only open for about three or four hours each
day.  I wasn't surprised but still it would have been nice to poke
around inside and see some things.  There are a lot of comic and
sci-fi shops right in the district of the hotel, and we walk by at
least three bookstores on the way to the metro station every day.

The ride on the metro to the Champ du Mars station wasn't that bad,
and we took a short walk along the seine towards the Eiffel Tower at a
leisurely pace.  The tower is bigger than you picture it because it's
usually taken from very far away.  It really is as tall as a
skyscraper.  The queue for going up to the higher levels of the tower
was too long, so we just walked underneath it and took some photos,
and then stopped on the Champ du Mars for a little while and
people-watched some tourists.  Afterwards we walked underneath the
tower again and up the Jardins du Trocadero, which was a nice uphill
climb but we got to see the fountains go off, which was a nice sight
to see right in front of the Eiffel Tower.  It is also a pretty good
picture shot.

I wanted to see the Arc du Triomphe, so we got on the metro at
Trocadero station and off at Etoil&eacute; station.  It is definitely
an arc, and it's in the middle of a huge roundabout.  We didn't fancy
going up a lot of stairs to the top, so we basically just went in a
little loop around it and then back to the metro to visit the [Musee
du Parfum][2], which was mostly a lot of things used in perfume
making - it was all true stuff but it was all attached to a perfume
maker's shop so it wasn't as well kept as perhaps a real museum.  I'm
not complaining any though because it was free and the things there
were actually pretty neat to see all of the methods that are used in
order to get the fragrance out of the flowers and other parts of
things.  There was no pictures, but that didn't make that much sense,
there wasn't much there that was really picture-worthy anyway.

Afterwards we were getting hungry again, so I wanted to seek out a
shop on the way.  We both were getting tired of the whole rigamarole
around eating at a Caf√©, so we stopped at a fast food boulangerie and
had a sandwich and some stuff.  I was happy because I got to order a
formul&eacute; which was actually a lot cheaper than the ingredients
separately.  Leave it to me to be happy about ordering a happy meal.
I got a suissage sandwich and strawberries with a drink.  It was
actually really great, filling enough but it only took about half an
hour to eat and was less than 10 &euro;!  If we come back to Paris I
think that we will eat from these small shops during the day more,
because it is much cheaper.

Afterwards we walked through the Op&eacute;ra district and scoffed at
some of the fancy shops there that had super overpriced things that
are all available in the US, and are just expensive because you're
buying them in the shop in Paris of course.  The same brands that you
would find at a high-end shopping mall in the US.  We reached our goal
for resting in the afternoon around 2PM which was the Jardin des
Tuileries.  There are a lot of flowers and a bunch of places to rest,
which we did.  It was a nice day outside and the sun was shining.
I decided to give up on l'Orangerie for the day because it was going
to just be not enough time to do both of the museums, and we went to
visit the Louvre again.  This time we saw all of the antiquities from
the middle east and just a few of the pictures from some French and
Dutch painters, and a lot more of the sculptures which were on the
other side of the building.

We decided that the street lunch was so successful that we should try
it for dinner as well, which we did by getting some sandwiches and
panini from a street vendor which was on the way home after another
ride on the metro.  The sandwiches were not as good as the ones we had
at lunch but they were still pretty good and they didn't come with
having to deal with a waiter and French table manners again (major
plus).  We also got some snacks and drinks from [8 &agrave; Huit][3]
to go with it.

I conked out again and we just ended up staying in the hotel room for
the rest of the night because I woke up at around 11pm, and thought it
would be a little late to go get anything for dinner or even a market
because the markets seem to close early-ish.  There isn't a 24h/24
market anywhere around here from what I can tell.  It turned out to be
pretty nice to see some of the sights and visit the Louvre again to
see a little more, and I was actually pleasantly surprised to walk
through a couple of the Jardins here in Paris which are very nice.
Again I was able to do some fun summer reading of [The Magician][4]
which is all set in Paris.  It is interesting timing at least, and
makes the book a little more interesting.
