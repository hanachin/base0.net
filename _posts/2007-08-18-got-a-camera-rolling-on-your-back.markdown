title: Got a camera rolling on your back
excerpt: For the last few weeks, I've been trying to participate in <a href="http://photojojo.com/content/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day/">Project 365</a>.  For those that don't know about it, it is the idea of taking one picture a day in order to accomplish.. something.  I'm mainly just doing it for fun, and in order to improve my picture-taking skills with my camera phone.   I have it walking around everywhere basically, so when I see something interesting, I try to have my phone at the ready.

For the last few weeks, I've been trying to participate in <a href="http://photojojo.com/content/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day/">Project 365</a>.  For those that don't know about it, it is the idea of taking one picture a day in order to accomplish.. something.  I'm mainly just doing it for fun, and in order to improve my picture-taking skills with my camera phone.   I have it walking around everywhere basically, so when I see something interesting, I try to have my phone at the ready.  Some times I just take pictures of  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jamuraa/1161207399/in/set-72157601532004533/">random</a><a> </a><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jamuraa/1162062936/in/set-72157601532004533/">stuff</a>, but others are <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jamuraa/1012736321/in/set-72157601532004533/">more</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jamuraa/1088783453/in/set-72157601532004533/">interesting</a>.

I've found that it's pretty useful for me.  If you see the set, you can almost notice a perceptible increase in quality of the photos.  It may just be because I'm taking 2-3 photos per day and choosing the best one, or I may be actually improving in my photo-taking abilities.  Hopefully by the end of the year, the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jamuraa/sets/72157601532004533/">set of mine</a> will actually have more than 300 photos in it.

The idea of taking a picture a day is quite interesting to me, if only because if you asked me what I was doing last year this time, I would probably give you a general idea because my life is basically boring - I work in an office, even when I'm at school.  This way I might have some idea or get reminded.

I do have a couple of kinks that I would like to work out when I'm doing it though - when I download my photos through Bluetooth using my phone, it sets all of the creation dates to the time that I transfer the photos instead of the time that I took the photos.  This means that I need to fiddle with the "taken on" date when I finish uploading the pictures - there's no way to use the <a href="http://flickr.com/tools/">Flickr Uploadr</a> to set the date.  This, and the horrible VGA camera that I have in the phone make it tempting for me to buy a new phone with a better camera and tools for transferring.  Also, some days I just stay in, and don't do anything interesting, so I don't have anything interesting or different to take a picture of.  I'm thinking of just taking a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jamuraa/1012736547/in/set-72157601532004533/">self-portrait</a> on those days, but I'm not sure that it would be interesting enough.
