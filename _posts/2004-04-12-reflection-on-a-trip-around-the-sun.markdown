Well, I'm one year older today, so I have been thinking since this morning about the last year, and what I have done in it.  It seems to be the correct time.

In the last year I have:
<ul>
	<li> Passed the Written Preliminary Exam, allowing me to continue pursuing a Ph.D degree in computer science at the University of Minnesota.</li>
	<li> Completed 16 hours of classes towards my degree, with a GPA of 3.78 in those classes.</li>
	<li> Was a Teaching Assistant for three classes, available to over 200 students.</li>
	<li> Paid $7,980.00 in rent at my apartment, approximately 51% of my total expected income in a year.</li>
	<li> Bought a new iBook 12" laptop and for the first time, put myself into debt which is not school-related.</li>
	<li> Had the first romantic relationship in my life since 1999.</li>
	<li> Started writing in LiveJournal, thanks to <a href="http://silvrayn.livejournal.com">silvrayn</a>.</li>
	<li> Contributed +1242 -724 lines of changes to the open source software project <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a></li>
	<li> Started one of the top sites for <a href="http://bt.base0.net/">Anime via BitTorrent</a>, whose torrents have transferred approximately 399.1 TB of Anime to the masses from 21 different fansubbing groups.</li>
	<li> Discovered that I like DDR and am actually not bad at it, most likely to the chagrin of the people in the apartment below me.</li>
	<li> Drank more alcohol than I had in my entire life before this day last year.</li>
	<li> Submitted a paper to two conferences, and got rejected from both.</li>
	<li> Watched more Anime than anyone else I know.</li>
	<li> Started a diet and successfully lost 41 pounds to date.</li>
</ul>
Some of these I regard as accomplishments.  Some are things I should fix in the future.  Some I'm kind of indifferent about.
