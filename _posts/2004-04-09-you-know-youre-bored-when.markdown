You decide that you want to check what all of the numbers from one to ten are on the internet.

<a href="http://www.one.com">One</a> - boring software solutions
<a href="http://www.two.com">Two</a> - something with flowers?
<a href="http://www.three.com">Three</a> - confusing but elaborate - I have no clue what they do, but I think it has something to do with cell phones.
<a href="http://www.four.com">Four</a> - online support
<a href="http://www.five.com">Five</a> - mysterious, black, enigma.
<a href="http://www.six.com">Six</a> - domain parked
<a href="http://www.seven.com">Seven</a> - something to do with cellphones and PIM stuff
<a href="http://www.eight.com">Eight</a> - online trading
<a href="http://www.nine.com">Nine</a> - number 9 technology, defunct video card company - I used to have a VGA card by these guys in like, high school.
<a href="http://www.ten.com">Ten</a> - erm, porn.  Definitely NSFW link.

You get quite the range of the internet when you do this.  I was so expecting to have a porn site on there somewhere.
