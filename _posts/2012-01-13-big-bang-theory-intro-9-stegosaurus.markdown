This time I could find the [source
image](http://www.jupiterimages.com/Image/royaltyFree/87596447) on
jupiterimages and many other sites.  The original is in color, and looks like
an interesting diorama or claymation setup.  Since the
[Apatosaurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatosaurus) was in the [last
picture](http://base0.net/posts/big-bang-theory-intro-8-apatosaurus/) as well,
I'm going to focus on the foreground beastie.

The [Stegosaurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosaurus) has long been one
of my favorite dinosaurs.  I always liked how his fins on the back looked, they
were spiky but they didn't have a lot of stuff.  Also many times they are
depicted as having a spiky tail, which I just thought was cool.  I learned that
there is some debate about whether they could actually use the spikes on the
tail as a weapon.

I also learned that they have two brains, one stored in the tail, which was
mentioned on
[Fringe](http://hellyeahfringe.tumblr.com/post/1321520386/did-you-know-that-the-stegosaurus-had-a-brain-in),
one of my favorite shows.  The second brain was not necessarily used for extra
storage, like posited on the show though, but more likely as some type of extra
brain processing like an extra core booting up when they were in a dangerous
situation.

Until researching for this post, I didn't know that there are states with 
[official state dinosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_dinosaurs).
The stegosaurus is the oldest state dinosaur, which Colorado [designated in 1982](http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/symbemb.htm#Fossil).
Denver's [Museum of Nature &amp; Science](http://www.dmns.org/) has one of only 6 on display in the country.
The fossil is in a [super-awesome display](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/DMSN_dinosaurs.jpg)
where there is a mother and baby Stegosaurus being attacked by an Allosaurus (T-Rex).
