I don't get much sleep.  When I tell people that I get to work at 5:30
in the morning most days, they are usually surprised, and often
afterwards they ask me when I go to bed.  When I tell them, then they
are even more surprised.  The answer that I give is between midnight
and 1am, which is true most of the time.  Lately, I've been trying to
get into bed before midnight, but I still often don't try to sleep
until after the witching hour (?).

I don't really seem to have a problem keeping up this sleeping
schedule on normal weekdays.  There is some leeway on the amount of
sleep that I get on the weekends, but usually my to-bed time isn't
changing, but rather just the wake-up time.   My alarm is set to 9am
on the weekends, but I'm also not worried about it being right next to
my head most of the time, so commonly I will sleep until 10 or 11
on Saturday and Sunday.  I've read a few articles that say that you
can [catch up on sleep][1], but then again, there are others that
don't believe it.

If I go through and do the math, these weekend sleeps aren't really
balancing out the score though: on an average weekday I will get
between 3 and 5 hours of sleep.  On a weekend, I increase that to 8 to
9 hours, and sometimes up to 10.  Doing the math, that's only about
six and a half hours per day when it comes to the end, still less than
the recommended amount of eight hours.

I've been confused as to why I can do this for a while now, especially
during the weekdays when there is so little sleep time.  I've read
about [polyphasic sleep][2] and [REM cycles][3], which suggest that I
am perhaps getting a single full sleep cycle in, and it just happens
to be convenient for the time that I've chosen to get up and head to
work in the morning.

Ever the experimenter, I tried napping during my lunch break for about
a month last year.  I would have my lunch out of the office, and then
start [sleep now](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mobitobi.android.sleepnow)
to wake me up half an hour later.  I did it because I read that just a
short nap can actually improve your mental condition for a long time
if you take it during the day.  It didn't work out for me, I just
ended up feeling no better or groggier than I did before.  Possibly
it was because I was doing it in the full sunlight, as there is some
evidence that you need to have a dark room for good sleep.

Alternately, I could be actually detrimental some part of my day,
penalizing the work that I do in the evening towards my thesis, or
making it that much harder to concentrate on the programming that I do
on my spare time.  Then my lack of shut-eye could be actually hurting
my life.  It's just one more thing to worry about, so I usually just
keep doing what is working for now, and maybe worry about it later.
