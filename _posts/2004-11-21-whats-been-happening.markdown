I've not been quite the busy blogging bee lately.  This is proabbly becuase of one of five things:
<ul>
	<li>CSci 5302</li>
	<li>TAing CSci 1901</li>
	<li>Grading for CSci 4131</li>
	<li>Reading for new RA</li>
	<li>Various Business Stuff</li>
</ul>
These are of course in order of time taken.  I have been to a lot of movies, and been reading a few books. The books wil get reviewed first, because generally I like to be more detailed on them, and they're more interesting to me.

I have had some time to update my <a href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=jamuraa%40debian.org&amp;comaint=yes">Debian packages</a>, pushing out a new bogosort (who would have thought that package needed updating) and a new bittorrent which fixes a fair amount of bugs and represents my first multiple package source, after caving to pressure and separating the gui elements of bittorrent.   I have another rant about bittorrent, but that will have to wait for another day.

Di is still being the beautiful and wonderful person she is, which makes me a happy camper most of the time.  She just got laid off this friday, but she has been taking it rather well considering.  It probably helps that she has interviews/tests with a handful of temp agencies next week, and other jobs.

I've been homeworkfull of course, and TAing taking up the rest of my time.   Of course a 50+ student class who has assignments due every week takes up a large portion of my time.  At least the class is on things that I do just for fun - Internet Programming.  The most recent assignment was a movie database with actors, movies, directors, etc.  all editable from a web interface.  It would probably freak the students out to tell them that I did something much more complicated than this in my free time in order to keep track of my anime obsession.   I didn't quite get to the level of actors, but I have compiled my share of web-accessible and editable databases.   Sometimes I wish I had kept them all around, even the ones that I half-completed, in order to somehow monitor my progress or something.

I had a crash of one of my computers in the last month that I haven't been updating.   After a few days of technical voodoo, I declared my firewall sisko dead to the world and recovered it's 250GB of anime in an LVM to my main machine odo.  As part of the voodoo I had acquired another 250GB drive, which was happily added to the anime volume in order to have a cool .5TB of space for anime.   I reconfigured my newly acquired WRT54G in order to run linux and be a firewall and traffic shaper and it has been running swimmingly so far.

On the blogging front, other than not updating at all, the <a href="http://www.base0.net">front page</a> of my blog got a small change to it's header which I think is slightly more pleasing to the eye, plus it allows me to put nifty pictures of stuff I see in the twin cities for all to see.   I was considering a much more bland reworking, but that got scrapped because it took too much CPU and content.   I will probably be adding buttons and screwing with plugins soon, as I have not been too happy with <a href="http://www.chait.net/index.php?p=238">ChaitGear's Amazon plugin</a>.   Being that Amazon's web services aren't that bad, I hope to write a book reader's plugin fairly soon for wordpress.  I also hope to be able to post some of my other recent hacks on the site, right after I figure out a decent place for them.  For now, I'm going to get back to my reading.
