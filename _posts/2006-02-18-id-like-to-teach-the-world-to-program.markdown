title: I'd Like to Teach the World to Program
excerpt: <p>A couple weeks ago I was going to lunch and met up with one of my friends who I hadn't seen in a while.  I had to wait for her to finish her TAing job, in the same lab that I once taught in.  I was surprised at my reaction - I wanted to jump right into the room and start helping out.  I restrained myself, but it gave me a good reminder of what my actual goal is in grad school.   I want to be a professor - I wasn't sure when I started here at the U of M, but after two or three teaching sessions I was certain I was going to teach.

A couple weeks ago I was going to lunch and met up with one of my friends who I hadn't seen in a while.  I had to wait for her to finish her TAing job, in the same lab that I once taught in.  I was surprised at my reaction - I wanted to jump right into the room and start helping out.  I restrained myself, but it gave me a good reminder of what my actual goal is in grad school.   I want to be a professor - I wasn't sure when I started here at the U of M, but after two or three teaching sessions I was certain I was going to teach.  It probably helped that it was a class which I have a good amount of experience teaching, being one of the classes I helped with for 3 semesters.

Lately I've been trying to remember why I am going through with it all in order to get the Ph.D, and seeing that class was a good reminder.  It makes me think that I might want to request a Teaching Assistant job every year or so just to keep me on the right track towards something.  Unfortunately, I think if I want to finish in a reasonable amount of time, I will need to focus 100 percent on the thesis before long.
