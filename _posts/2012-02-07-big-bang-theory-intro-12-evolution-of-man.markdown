Oh boy, a controversial topic.  Well, controversial to some.

This is a fairly famous image and most people recognize it now as a symbol of the
evolutionary process.  I couldn't find the exact source image for this, but there are literally
[thousands of versions][1] of it around the web.  Although many would attribute the original
idea to [Charles Darwin][7], I couldn't find anything even similar to this in all his illustrations, 
which are [all available online][8].

Personally, I have a belief in the theory of evolution, if only because you can see it
from first principles and it makes sense to me.  You can simulate it with a basic set of
rules, and see [natural selection][2] happen over thousands of generations, which makes up
a significant part of evolution.   If you accept some basic assumptions, it's pretty easy to simulate.
There was a [marginally popular video][12] which explained it, but that got also turned into a
[javascript thingy][13] which works pretty good as well.

There are a ton of parodies of this depiction out there.  I am a big fan of the [computer-based one][3]
where we eventually evolve into typing on computers, because honestly I spend most of my day in front
of a computer (although I'm [standing more][4] when typing lately).  There's also one with the
obvious natural ending of the [obese man][5] which seems to be fairly popular, and there are a large number
of [cartoons][6] making fun of the image in one way or [another][9].

Interestingly, there is some thought that evolution has stopped or slowed because we have
[less prolific fathers][10] than we had before, and possibly because we are somehow cheating
the natural selection by the [use of technology][11].  I've wondered about this for a while,
and I think it's interesting both from a scientific perspective, as well as a ethical perspective.
If we are somehow cheating natural selection through technology, is it a bad thing?  Ethically,
there are a lot of questions about the existence of genetically passed diseases and whether someone
should procreate based on knowing that their child might be diseased simply because of your genes.  I
don't have a good answer, but it is the type of question which I wish would be asked and debated more
than whether evolution is actually valid.
