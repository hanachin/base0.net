It's round, and it rolls.  Nothing like the wheel.

The Wheel is one of the inventions that is always pointed towards as one of the earliest
smart things.  You see them on a ton of advertisements for patent filing stuff.  The
[source image][1] this time was from a different source.  I think that I could make an
argument for [Irrigation][2], since it has been around longer and has more of an impact
on civilization when it happens.  [The Wheel][3] showed up on vehicles starting in
around 4th century BC, and they were using irrigation in ancient Persia almost 2000
years before that.

Reinventing the wheel is something that people are supposed to avoid, but there's
always something to be said for improving on a design.  There isn't a ton of things that
you can do to improve on the round shape though.  Then again, if the roads were slightly
differently constructed, then [square wheels would work fine][4].

One of the best reinventions, or improvements, to the wheel, was done by [John Boyd Dunlop][5]
who invented the pneumatic tire, which uses the property that air is an incompressible fluid
and a rubber tube in order to make it possible for the tire to roll over small bumps and rocks
without damaging the tire.  It will just roll over, compressing and expanding the rest of the tire
until the obstacle is over.  This provides a type of shock absorption as well.

Even though they have a lot of advantages, airless tires have been one of the things that you
always hear as coming in the next few years.  Some of the more recent ones are from [Bridgestone][6]
and [Michelin][7].  They look pretty freaky when they are [in a moving car][8] though - almost like 
the [hovercar][9].
