I came across this book through a few interesting websites, <a href="http://43folders.com/">43folders</a> being one of them.  The "GTD" system for time management has been bandied around the geek-sphere recently it seems.  You don't actually have to read the book in order to get the main ideas of GTD, but I thought that dancing around the edges without diving in is a disservice to a system like this.   The good part is that it does actually help you, well, get things done.  Everyone has their own systems for figuring out what needs to be done in a day - this book seems to distill a bunch of good ideas into one system which works decently well.  I have implemented it myself and present my findings here.  If you find that your life is in disarray and you can't decide what to do (what did you do yesterday? why didn't you do X?) then you may want to give this book a try.
