Okay so this is a little later than it should be.  In fact the charts are about
two weeks old at this point, but I thought that I would write about it anyway.
My diet has been going pretty well.  January was a pretty successful month on
the diet front, and pounds are coming off.  My plans for exercise were working
well and there was nothing really to complain about.  Normally I have a pretty
hard time keeping on the diet in the early part of the year because of all of
the things that seem to coalesce and keep me from doing what I want to do.

This time it was no different, but I was more determined to stick with the diet
because of all of the progress that I made all of last year, and so that I can
make my goals this year, to be a smaller me.  The things that all pile up in the
beginning of the year are mostly just one big factor, and that's people who are
trying to lose weight.  I know that it's kind of hypocritical to be annoyed at
people who want to trim the fat just like I do, but the problem is that they
take up a lot of the space in the exercise room and make it too busy for the
rest of us.  I think that I am going to try a different tack in the next month. 

Another thing that frustrates me about the new year is that there are a lot of
holidays that come up and you want to eat at them.  Usually the one that I have
the most trouble with is Valentines, because there is so much chocolate around,
and also I really like to spoil my sweetie with a big dinner and some candies
and other gifts on Valentines.  This time I will be scheduling a "cheat day"
with the outage, so it won't be that big of a deal I hope.

I've been a little less frequent on the [Loseit](http://reddit.com/r/loseit)
group recently, mostly because I have been busy with client work that I hope
that I will probably be blogging a little about soon.  The stories there are
still very inspiring and honestly the thing that I was bitching about last month
with people who just want to lose a few pounds isn't that bad.  Reddit is a
pretty good community, and loseit is an excellent example of that.

This chart is my triumph for the beginning of the year.  An entire month with no
red marks at all!  I have been losing for the whole month according to my stats
at PhysicsDiet, and that makes me happy.   The calorie deficit is pretty nice,
too, and the average weight lost per week is exactly in the range that I've been
setting for myself.  If I can just keep this up, I will make my goals nicely.

The yearly chart is a little more conservative on the account of me having those
days at the beginning of the year where I was above the trend line.  It's still
pretty nice though.  I am not going to include the all-time chart except at
major milestones from now on.

For February, I'm doing a new experiment with my diet.  I'm forgoing the
exercise completely in order to get a good gauge on how many calories I need to
be eating to lose weight.  That means that I'm going to be counting calories
pretty religiously, trying to figure out how many calories are in things that
are home-made (and estimating high when possible).   I've been going on net
calories right now, which means calories in minus calories exercised, and I
have suspicion that the machines may be telling me the wrong amount.  We'll see
how the graph looks later this month.

Because of a trick of how often I'm updating now (whenever one of my columns
runs out in my weight log), I will probably update again in February on the
diet.  See you then!
