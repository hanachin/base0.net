It's a monkey!  And something that's genetically related to humans.  The
[original image](http://www.jupiterimages.com/Image/royaltyFree/87629942) is in color, and
looks pretty nice.

Yes, I'm someone who believes in [evolution][1], which says that humans might
be descended from apes.  The [chimpanzee][2] used to believed to be 99% in common
with humans, but more recent studies suggest 94% or even as low as 86%.
Technically the chimpanzees are in the genus Pan, and not the Homo genus that
Homo sapiens are, but there are some [other species][4] in the Homo genus which are
less related than them.

They are the types of apes which have a strong social structure, with alpha males, empathy,
and use of tools.  There are the ones that [Dame Jane Goodall][5] were studying for the longest
time, and she discovered a lot of things about them, including the fact that they have
unique personalities for each chimp, and not just simple social norms.   I've always thought
that she was a good person, but was more convinced recently when I found out about
[this far side cartoon][6].  It was originally opposed by the Jane Goodall foundation, but
then the woman herself thought it was amusing and put a kibosh on the smackdown.  There's nothing like a sense of humor in
my book.  Now they [sell a shirt][8] with the cartoon on it.

Closer to home, the [Como Zoo][9] is building a habitat for some apes that 
will be done in 2013 that they're calling the [Gorilla Forest][10].  This is a
big improvement to the current habitat that
they have for the big apes.  They also have a bunch of other monkeys and apes in the 
primate house.  The designs look like the visitors will be able to get pretty close to the
gorillas, which will be interesting to see.
