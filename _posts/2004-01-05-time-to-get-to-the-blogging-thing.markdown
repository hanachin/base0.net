I'm trying out this live-journal thing to find out if I can get the journal looking like my <a href="http://www.base0.net">base0</a> homepage.  If I can't, I'll probably be coding a bunch on that in eht next few days making it more featureful by adding categories or something.  I'm in search of good blogging software, both to post and customize.  <a href="http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/">Pybloxsom</a> really appeals to me from a hacker's point of view, but everyone who uses it seems to be very non-creative or it's not very customizable.  I'd like to see one that is "tricked out", that has images and things floating around, with moods or whatever.  I also looked at <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>, but it looks like it would be a pain to setup, and it looks like it's not really free as Debian would define it, which I prefer stuff I use to be.  Oh well, this is just a first post really, explaining why I actually have a livejournal now.
