Passwords on websites are one of the worst things that the distributed
internet has come up with.  I have to have logins and passwords for
hundreds of sites that I need to keep separate and ideally, different
in order to be completely secure.  I've decided to use a password
locker for that purpose, which makes it much easier to remember all of
them, because I only need to remember one **very** secure password.

One of the best features of using a password locker for passwords is
that you can generate a new unique password for every site that you
need to make a login for.  My default setting makes every password
something that I could probably not remember if I was doing it on my
own: 30 characters, with a mix of upper, lower, numbers, symbols, and
special characters.

Of course now we get to the point of this post.  Almost every site out
there has some type of restriction on the passwords that they allow.
Usually I need to drop the number of characters, and sometimes I need
to drop the sets of characters to something less secure.  I don't
really have a big problem with that, although it's completely stupid
(in most cases, the underlying technology can support all of them).

The problem that I have is that they have these restrictions and then
don't tell you about them, until you've already completed the whole
form, generated the password and submitted it.  Then it comes with an
error that says something like "password must be less than 12
characters" (which I've seen in variants as low as 8 maximum).
Another variant is "you have entered an invalid character for this
field".  That is not helpful.  Which character was it?  What ones are
allowed?

The worst ones are the ones where there are multiple
restrictions, but it only tells you about one at once.   Three or four
times I have to submit the form with more and more insecure passwords.
It is not making me want to use your websites, and it's just pissing
me off.

Of course the solution to this dilemma would be to have some
universal login for the entire internet, but that's not going to
happen any time soon.  OpenID gave it a good shot, but it didn't work
very well overall.  Facebook and Google are giving it a sporting
chance, and Twitter is a close third, with a number of others who are
trying to use OAuth to become a user silo.  I'm not happy with any of
these, but they're better than having a login everywhere.
