  It's not the reason that you think.  Sure, it includes a bunch of iPod functionality, but that's not what I'm referring to.

It's not the reason that you think.  Sure, it includes a bunch of iPod functionality, but that's not what I'm referring to.  Not the least of which is, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/macworld2007/apple-iphone-the-specs--official-press-release-227530.php">absolutely</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/43Folders/~3/73121122/">everyone</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/73068768/iphone_macworld07_keynote.php">is</a> <a href="http://blogumentary.typepad.com/chuck/2007/01/omfg.html">talking</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/sborsch/ctd/~3/73057541/iphone_changing.html">about</a> <a href="http://www.tribulaciones.org/blog/computers/geek/iphone_09-01-2007.">this</a> <a href="http://www.twistermc.com/blog/2007/01/09/apple-iphonepdaipod-wow">device</a>.  I haven't seen this much buzz over a device in a long time.

Buzz is definitely nice, and warranted, but that's not why either.  Back in the day when the iPod was released, everyone thought that it was going to flop - because it had a hard drive, and almost all of the players at the time were using flash.  The iPod changed the mp3 player from a device that had a tiny screen that you could display maybe 2 lines of text (if you were lucky), and that you needed a course in computers to use, to a high-resolution screen, easy to use device.  Nothing else at the time was even close.  It succeeded because of it's <strong>complete rethinking of the user interface</strong>, and that is why the iPhone is the next iPod.  This got pretty long, so I'm cutting it.  (Sorry, people who hate clicking!)
