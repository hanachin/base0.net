In the past week, I've programmed for at least an hour in:
 - Ruby (with and without Rails)
 - Javascript
 - Python
 - C++
 - Embedded C
 - Java
 - Non-trivial Makefiles
 - HTML and CSS (if we want to count them)

If we went back a month, we could add C# to that list, as well as
[the go language][1], and the ever so strange [awk][2].  If I was
pressed to write down on a resume all of the languages that I have
programmed in, it would probably take up at least a quarter of a page,
especially if they wanted me to list the frameworks that I've used in
each of them.

Lately I've been counting about how many languages I use on a regular
basis, because it seems like I am a programmer that
seems to jump from language to language, using whatever is most
convenient at the time.  If I want to make something, I just choose
the tool out of the toolbox that seems reasonable to get the job done,
and start hacking away.  I'll pick up Python, Ruby or Perl randomly
when I want to get a more-complex-than-a-shell-script thing done.

I don't know why I have this outlook on my language selection, and I
was blissfully unaware that it was somewhat bizarre until recently,
when I've been noticing more that people seem to focus their
programming attention on one or two languages, and don't really delve
deep into any others.  People will stay in a single job coding .NET
applications for years at a time, and not look at any other language.
That seems quite bizarre for me.

I've been wondering what this means for me as a professional
developer.  The resume question specifically is interesting to me.  As
someone who can legitimately name a product that I've shipped in so
many languages, does it make me look better or worse for me to put all
of them onto my skills list?  Will they assume that I'm just padding
the list with languages that I've only tinkered in?   Of course, this
is all just a curiosity because I'm quite happy in the career that
I've chosen now, but it's still something I think about.

I'm also thinking about whether I have been going about it all
wrong - would I be better off as a developer if I had a
single-language focus?  Could I finish more projects if I did so?
Maybe I should try to pick one or two of the
languages and then convert everything to those, and I will actually be
more productive.  It's hard to judge these things because I've always
been the person who is interested not only in being familiar with a
language, but building a decent size project in each one.  For
example, I've been thinking of building a side project in
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/), not because I have a pressing need to
learn a JavaScript-based event-driven framework, but just because it
looks interesting.

It seems like most of the developers that I know that are into as many
languages also have an interest in compilers - but I'm not that
interested in them myself.  Parsers of course are part and parcel of
any programmer's toolbox, if only because sometimes a domain-specific
language is what will be the most powerful and useful, but I have
never been interested in taking things down to the machine level
myself.

I know that there are other people with at least a curiosity into
other languages like I have, because there is a [Twin Cities Languages
User Group](http://www.twincitieslanguagesusergroup.com) that I've
attended a couple of times.  It's been a while since I've been back at
that group, and my life is a little too busy to attend again.  It was
a short look at a bunch of different languages, which was pretty
great.

I'm not sure that I'll ever stop learning the new languages and
frameworks of the times.  I consider it a good thing on the whole
because I am flexible to do things like start programming an Android
app, or pick up Objective C in order to hack away at a iOS app.
Whatever next new language is coming around the corner, you can
probably bet that I'll be programming something in it eventually.
