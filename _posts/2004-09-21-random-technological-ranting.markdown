After spending the morning doing things that are throughly unproductive, I have a couple of things that bother me about the world right now, mostly technical.

Why doesn't <a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Planet Debian</a> advertise the availablility of an RSS feed in it's output, but not to automatic readers.   I expect that an age where aggregators are more common to everyone (OS X 10.4, anyone?) will accelerate greatly the age of the content web - more and more people will not be using the web for nice-looking sites, but for the content on them.  This could cause issues with advertisers, who on major sites could make it harder for information to flow freely from sources to sinks.

While Apple's Mail.app looks nice and works well, it is lacking at least two major features.  The first is decent threading.  We've had this for years in the world of mutt and any graphical mail reader I get will be required to have one.  This is currently the only thing that is keeping me from using Mail.app for my main mailreader.  The other thing that I want a graphical mail reader to do is work with GnuPG.  It would be nice to have it auto-check people's signatures.  I think I've come to the conclusion that I want "mutt with graphics".  Of course, some would tell me to get off my ass and make one if I want it so bad, but I suspect that one may exist already and I don't know that it exists yet.

I've wanted to put an install of Debian on my iBook for a while, but I have been foiled by the fact that I use it daily and cannot cripple it.  I need to figure out a way to copy all important data off so I can repartition correctly and reinstall both OS X and Debian.  I think I am going to have issues with the Debian side of things, but I've been away from <a href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=jamuraa@debian.org">my Debian packages</a> too long and I am feeling very bad about it.

I haven't been active on <a href="http://www.gale.org/">gale</a> in a while, but I'm toying with the idea of joining the conversation again.  I've always liked the people there - for some reason they seem very nice.

My favorite site for a long time <a href="http://www.halfbakery.com">Halfbakery</a>, has been down yesterday and today.  It was the clearinghouse for me to spout crazy ideas that come into my head every once in a while.  I may have to spout some crazy ideas here instead because they're bouncing around up there.
