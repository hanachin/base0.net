title: And now for something completely different
excerpt: |-
  I found out this thursday that <a href="http://www.uni.edu">my alma mater</a> got into the NCAA tournament this year.  It's a smaller school, mostly a suitcase college for most of the surrounding area.   That doesn't stop them from having a great education program and business school.  They played Friday, and while they lost, they put up a <a href="http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/gamecenter/recap/NCAAB_20040319_NIA@GATECH">good fight</a> if you ask me.
  
  Posts about spring break and such coming soon.
