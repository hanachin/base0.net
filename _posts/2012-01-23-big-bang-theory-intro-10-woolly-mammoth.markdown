It's a [Wooly Mammoth][1]!  Look at how huge it is.  Wait, the cropped version
here doesn't have a good sense of scale - maybe you should gander at the
[source image from photos.com][2], where there is a friendly scared dude with a
spear to see how big this guy actually was.  They could get almost 10 feet
tall.  Unlike everything up until now, there is actually some evidence that
humans, or neandertals were around when the mammoths were walking around,
because there are some cave paintings.

One of the most interesting parts about these large creatures, are that they
often aren't fossilized, but just freeze in place, so you can end up finding
one just frozen solid.  I've thought sometimes in the Minnesota winter that I
might end up in a similar fate.  The latest one was found [less than five years
ago][3].  They are often still found with their soft tissue intact.  This means
that there might actually be a real-life [Jurassic Park][4] situation, where
they could extract the DNA of a frozen specimen and make up a clone.  It
doesn't look like there is an actual clone coming anytime soon though.
