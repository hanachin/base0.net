I've kind of stumbled onto a habit recently, which surprised me because
usually I have to work at my habits for a while before I can really
make them work for me.  Overall, it's been a positive thing in my life
so far, but I would probably not say it's for everyone or even for me
unless I keep it up for a while. Lately I've been getting up early, and going
into work early as well.

It started last week when I had to travel down to lower Minnesota for
a trip for my work.  The trip down takes about two hours, so usually
when people go down they leave at 7am in hopes of getting in a full
work day or close to it and getting back into the cities at a
reasonable time.  There isn't anything wrong with that for me -
normally I would be getting into the office around 7am anyway.
However this time there was some confusion about whether we were going
to visit at all, and because of that confusion I had to finish up some
things at the office before we departed.  That meant getting into the
office at 6.

So I set myself for getting in at 6am, and put my alarm back another
hour from where it had been set before.  I was happy to find out that
my whole day went a bit smoother when I got up around 5am instead of
6am: my commute was easier, my work got done quicker than I had
planned (although still not done on time, I had to code on the trip
down), and there was very little distraction.  I decided that if I
could get up so early for a single day, then it was possible that I
could do it for everyday.  I resolved to make it a daily thing, and
I've been getting to work at 6am since.

The benefits magnified when I wasn't under the pressure to get
everything done before 7am as well.  Being the first to get into the
office meant that I had to make the coffee, but that meant that I
could make it and get the first cup, and enjoy a bunch of
uninterrupted time.  As many people have noted, programmers like
myself abhor the interruptions of a normal office environment, and it
as been stated that it might even be a 15 minute setback every time
someone asks a "quick question" because you need to get back "into the
zone".

Another benefit is leaving earlier from work, because I still usually 
stay for my prescribed 9.5-10 hours, which leaves
a decent chunk of time between leaving time at work and the time when
most things are scheduled at night.  Having those two hours between
"get home" and "social time" makes it a lot easier to work on my
thesis, or get some consulting work done, making my day more
accomplished even when I do have something to do in the evening,
instead of having to set aside whole nights of my schedule for those
activities.

There are a couple of things that could threaten this early wake-up
time.   If Diana doesn't like it in the long run, or it's too
disturbing to her sleep cycle for me to get up at such an early time,
it's a no go of course.  If people at work start complaining, I might
push back a little bit saying that I get the uninterrupted time, but
if they are a little insistent I'll probably cave and switch back to a
7am show-up time.  It might start grinding on me differently
than it is now, and I could decide to change my habits on my own
again.  For now, it seems like I've stumbled into an early riser
habit.
