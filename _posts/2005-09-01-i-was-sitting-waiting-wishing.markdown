Well, after I got everything done on the list today the movers came and moved all fo the stuff.  Di showed up at just the right time and the timing was perfect with the movers and the keys and everything.  Got out of it far under the budget I was planning on.  Unfortunately the entire new place is filled with boxes and nothing is unpacked right now.

The new place is great - even with all of the boxes it's better than the old apartment.  Diana likes it a ton as well so I think we're going to be good here until we move somewhere permanent.  First utility to be tested in the new apartment?  Cable internet of course.  It's working fine!
