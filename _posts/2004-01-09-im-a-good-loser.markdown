Hehe. Scrabble rules.  I played alot of Settlers of Catan last night, but didn't win any.  The night before was Starfarers of Catan, didn't win any of those either.  So tonight, tonight should be the night that I can win ALL of the games.   I'm just waiting for my comeuppins!   I'm kinda glad that noone has released any new anime episodes I'm interested in the last few days.  Mabye it's because they're kinda between seasons in japan.
