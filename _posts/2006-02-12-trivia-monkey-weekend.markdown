So this weekend is Trivia weekend, which means that my clock gets inverted for a couple days at least, as I tend to be on the "night team".  Right now it's the beginning of hour 40, of which I've been around for about half.   We just found out we're ahead of the team on the other side of the city. Hooray!

Holy Hell. Audio Speed Round.
