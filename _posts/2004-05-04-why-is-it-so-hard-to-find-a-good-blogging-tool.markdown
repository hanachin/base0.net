I've been looking for a good blogging tool all afternoon today, and the best open-source one I have found is pyblosxom, which I'm incindentally using now in order to write this entry.  It is a huge hassle to setup though - much easier to just use <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a>, and LJ has much nicer community properties.  The problem with LJ: I can't limit my entries, so unless I want everyone on <a href="http://planet.debian.net">Planet Debian</a> reading about my weekend drinking, I would have to set
everything to friends-only except for ones which have a tech component.  Granted, I could just start talking about tech stuff way more often than I do now, but I'd rather not put everyone into that group.   I wish there was a way to categorize entries on LJ so that I can just mark the entries I want to be syndicated.
