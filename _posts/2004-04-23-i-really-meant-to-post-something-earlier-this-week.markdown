I've been meaning to update more often.  Guess that goal isn't being reached.

Anyway, to finish out my weekend last week, I went with <a href="http://jwendl.livejournal.com">jwendl</a> to see Kill Bill vol. 2, which I thought was much better than the first one, mostly because it had more plot.  It seemed like it has a larger variety of influences than the first movie.  I do enjoy the style of the first movie, however - the swordfight scene in the snow was exquisite.  The new movie had more style, I thought.   It may be too plot/dialog for some though.

After the movie I met up with Di and her friend at Gameworks.  I hadn't been there in a while, and forgot the sweet sweet joy of alcohol and games mixed.  Justin and I played a few games of DDR - which I happily won, even though I'm horribly out of practice (<a href="http://silvrayn.livejournal.com">silvrayn</a>, I'm raiding your apartment soon!).  Also got to play some skee-ball and various other games of little importance.  Night hilight: genuine high school moment.

The week was fairly run-of-the-mill at school, except that I was strangely late all this week - except today.  It's very bizarre, because I don't think I've been to my Friday office hours on time yet this semester.  The crunch is fastly approaching, when all classes (including the one I TA) will have a deluge of assignments and exams at the same time.  I have a feeling that I will be a much lazier and happier man 3 weeks from now.

I've begun yet another project at work which I'm slacking off on, even though it will not take too long to get finished.  One of these days I'm going to actually promise something by a time and actually have it done when I promised it.  It's like I have the old-timers software engineering illness or something where you give time estimates which are best case scenarios and then never come through.  Yesterday I went home on my break time to finish it, and then somehow got no work done on it there.  Anyway, this is a fairly simple database so I should have it done by the end of the weekend, if not by the end of the day today.  It will make my new duties at work much, much simpler however.

I don't think I've told the good news in this forum yet: I am the proud recipient of a TA appointment for the summer, and a promise of a TA appointment for fall and spring of next academic year.  This makes me very happy because I didn't really expect to be able to teach through next year as well.  I did have high hopes for the summer, however.  It also helps that it is the source of all of my income.

Wow, I have a lot more to say.  I'm out of time though, so I will save the rest for a post later today.  Note to self: need more userpics.
