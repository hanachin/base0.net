Travelling through time in the Big Bang Theory opening barrage of pictures, we are only on the third of the total 110 pictures in the visual collage.   It's going to get a little more interesting after this, but this one seems more interesting than the <a href="http://base0.net/node/309">last</a> <a href="http://base0.net/node/310">two</a>.  Feast your eyes:

This is a microscopic picture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolaria">Radiolaria</a>.  Again the image comes from <a href="http://www.jupiterimages.com/popup2.aspx?navigationsubtype=itemdetails&amp;itemID=23373250">Jupiter Images</a>.   They represent a species which has been around for a very long time, since the Cambrian period, so basically 500 MILLION years ago.  Because they have been around for so long, but not forever, finding fossils of the Radiolaria are important for dating things.

Radiolaria were popular with amateur scientists in the victorian era thanks to some elaborate drawings that are now part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haeckel_Phaeodaria_1.jpg">wikimedia commons</a>.  Some of these cellular organisms can become very complex and beautiful.  They are still inspiring artists today, as seen on the <a href="http://www.radiolaria.org/arts.htm">art page</a> at <a href="http://www.radiolaria.org/">Radiolaria.org</a>.

Wonderful.
