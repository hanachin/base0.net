I've been [dieting][1] [lately][2], which means that I am weighing
myself pretty regularly now.  I try to weigh myself every day.
Because I'm trying to be so consistent, and I
don't have some kind of [fancy scale][3], just this [cheapo
scale][4], I've had some troubles over the years getting a consistent
read out of my scale.  I've finally got it working about as best as I
can expect out of what I have, so I thought I would write down the
tricks that I use to get as consistent as possible.

One thing that I have gleaned from my job working with electronic
components and also looking at some hobby robotics and destroying my
old scale to see how it worked was how the new scales that are cheap
and completely electronic work.  The scale itself doesn't have any
springs in it at all, just a circuit board with some wires leading out
to four sensors, which are attached directly to the feet of the scale.
Many times you can see that the feet aren't actually touching the
bottom plastic piece of the scale - that's because they need to be
attached to the sensor plate.  The body of the sensor is attached to
the bottom of the scale.  From there, the body is attached to the rest
of the scale so that when you step on the scale from the top, the
entire body of the scale is pushed down and the feet are effectively
pushed into their sensors, giving a sensor reading.

The sensors are calibrated to give a reading which you can then use a
simple lookup table in a microprocessor to see what it is supposed to
represent in pounds.  Of course there are four feet, so that means
that they're not exactly on, but the scale manufacturer assumes that
there is about one fourth of your weight distributed on each
one of the sensors.  This brings us to tip number one, the most
important:

### Stand as close to the center of the scale as possible

This means that your weight will be distributed so as to make the
assumptions of the manufacturer as correct as possible.  Using this
first rule, you will get as an accurate a weight every time you step
on the scale.  If you have to move the scale to the center of the room
in order to stand on the center and not tilt yourself, do so.  There's
a tip later if you have to move the scale every time.

Of course, that's not the whole story, because you want to have a
consistent weighing over **multiple days**.   That means that you need
to take into account three more things.  The first is that [more than
half of you is water][5].  This means that the amount of water that
you drank in the last 24 hours and how hydrated you are right at the
moment that you weigh is going to make a big difference.  If you're a
heavy person like I am, just two percent of your body weight is easily
5 pounds.  The second is more obvious than the first, and that is that
you will gain a different amount of weight throughout each day based
on what you eat and drink versus your elimination.  That means that
weighing at the end of the day is completely useless.  The third is 
even more obvious: your clothes weigh different amount every day.
These three facts bring us to tip number two:

### Weigh yourself at the beginning of the day, naked.

Weighing yourself at the beginning of the day in the buff will give
you the most consistent reading day-over-day that you can get.  This
is because after a night's sleep, you are about as dehydrated as
you're going to get in the day.  That minimizes the impact of the body
water that you have around.  It also means that you probably have
digested most of your food from the previous day, and you don't have
clothes tying you down.

The third tip that I use is one that is mental.  Many of the dieters
that I have conversed with (hi [/r/loseit][6]!) have a problem
mentally with getting on the scale every day.   Getting on the scale
every day is very important to me in order to keep the accurate
graphs that accompany my reports.  To get all of that data, I keep a
logbook right next to my scale, and I put my weight in it.

It's a simple book with the date, and the weight that I read off of
the scale on that day.  Even though it just looks like a weight log,
it also doubles as a motivational tool!  Because this type of logging
lets me see all of the numbers very quickly, it's easy enough to look
back a month (it's just one row over) and see my progress every day.
The number that's important to me is the number of a month ago minus
today, and it's always in the negative.  I've never been on the right
track and had that number come out positive.  Over a longer period of
time, all the variability of the last few days goes away.

Finally I have one final tip, which might not apply to everyone.  I
don't have space in my apartment bathroom to keep the scale on the
floor all the time, so I keep it on it's side under the sink.  This
means that the zero calibration of the sensors will be off the first
time I step on it every morning.  The solution is simple, and applies
if you have to move the scale every day as well.

### Place the scale on the floor in the same position every time.

### Ignore the first reading that you get - keep stepping on and off until you get two readings exactly the same

If you can't get the same reading from two weighings just seconds
apart, your scale is broken.  Get a new cheap one and use these tips
to weigh yourself consistently.

Following these tips, I've never had a problem with the 30 dollar
scale that I use every day to measure my weight.
