Or, I should say, online dating services suck.  I want to start dating now, and I figure since I'm a pretty online guy, I would go with an online dating service or 2.  I signed up at <a href="http://personals.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Personals</a> and <a href="http://www.match.com">Match.com</a> and put some words about me.  Words about me aren't that easy to come by for me, because I'm not a really introspective person.  I guess the main problem I have with personals sites is that they all cost money.  I'd certainly be willing to pay if I knew that someone was interested in me from these sites, but so far I've gotten one response from one person in the non-pay way (which are usually some sort of flirt or wink or something that you can't really put anything into).  Granted, I chat with that person regularly now, and she's great, but I kinda hoped for better.  Sometimes I think I'm just not suited to these types of things - that people have to get to know me first before they like me all that much.  Then again, I'm a fairly weird person by most people's standards. Oh well.
