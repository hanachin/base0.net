My thesis work has been going along somewhat smoothly lately, although
in the next few weeks, I'll be a little bit worried about how I am
going to get working on the second and last experiment of my thesis.
I've been putting polish on the first experiment client while I wait
for the IRB paperwork to come through so that I can actually release
and start the thing.  At this point, the client and website are
looking pretty polished, although I am somewhat worried that if I keep
adding statistics-crunching stuff to each results page, it will take a
long time or not respond well under load.  I guess we will see when
the client actually releases.

In preparation for the second experiment of the thesis, I've been
starting another literature review, to check and see what has happened
in the HRI field, or more specifically developments either
tangentially or fuzzily related to my thesis topic, in the last year.
One of the problems of working on the thesis while having a full time
job is that the progress is a bit slower than normal, and some stuff
can actually happen that you need to be keeping up on.

In the last two weeks, I've set aside one day, approximately two
hours, to look at the recent conferences and journals and pick out
papers which seem related.  It had been a while since I had been
looking through, so I really do have almost a full year of conferences
to wade through.  Some of these conferences, like [IROS 2011][1] and
[ICRA 2011][3] are
really large, with 70+ pages of titles and abstracts in IEEExplore.
Add to those the journals like [Transactions 
on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics][2] which not only have 6 fairly
large issues a year, but early access to unpublished but accepted
articles as well, there's a lot to go though.

After sifting through the papers and categorizing them in "really
related", "tangentially related", "somewhat related", "non-thesis
interest" categories, I move them over to my Dropbox account and then
get to reading them.  I used to read on my Kindle which worked pretty
well, especially with the note leaving feature, but I've started using
Goodreader on the iPad which has a number of ways of marking things,
and then happily emailing me the marks which not only works great for
point out passages or commenting on the entire article, which I like
to do at the end, but it is pretty great for highlighting references
which I will look up later.

Overall, I've been pretty happy with the reading day set aside.  I've
read two articles which are really relevant to my thesis work.  One
which got really close to what I am doing in my first experiment, but
is different in a significant way, and another which took a truly
interesting look at the analytical side of things and has a modeling
angle that I might seriously consider for future work.
I've also got partway through a journal article which I am hoping that
I will finish this week, that has a pretty good overview of the last
year or three.  I think that I'll keep reading at least one day a
week, so that I can keep up on the latest developments as they happen
from now on, instead of waiting for it all to pile up.  Also, it's a
great way to switch up the normal work that I have to do and relax
into the weekend.
