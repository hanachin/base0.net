  When was the last time you...
  
  <b>1. ...went to the doctor?</b>
  Last time I was sick enough - probably more than 4 years ago.
  
  <b>2. ...went to the dentist?</b>

  <b>3. ...filled your gas tank?</b>
  2 weeks ago
  
  <b>4. ...got enough sleep?</b>

  <b>5. ...backed up your computer?</b>
  the whole thing? never (crossing my fingers)
  I backup various important stuff (finances, tax records, etc) every month or so. (I should do that now)
