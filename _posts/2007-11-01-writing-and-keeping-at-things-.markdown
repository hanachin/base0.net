title: Writing and keeping at things.
excerpt: Life for me lately is a constant struggle between things that I want to do and things that I have to do - then again, this has been the truth for much of my life.  The current thing that I have to do is edit my thesis proposal.  Some of you may remember that I <a href="http://base0.net/archives/324-In-my-own-head-consume,-I-sit-down-in-my-room.html">had a plan</a> to write my thesis proposal over the last two months, and then I would use these last two months of the year to finish some actual pre-thesis work and edit the proposal down to size.

Life for me lately is a constant struggle between things that I want to do and things that I have to do - then again, this has been the truth for much of my life.  The current thing that I have to do is edit my thesis proposal.  Some of you may remember that I <a href="http://base0.net/archives/324-In-my-own-head-consume,-I-sit-down-in-my-room.html">had a plan</a> to write my thesis proposal over the last two months, and then I would use these last two months of the year to finish some actual pre-thesis work and edit the proposal down to size.  I didn't have a problem writing the thing - the work went quickly and spreading it out over two months was definitely the way to go.  However, now I have a 18,000 word thesis proposal breathing down my neck, waiting for me to do more research on it and edit it down to a more reasonable 12,000 to 15,000 words.   I also need to come up with a good schedule which is reasonable and doable.   I get the feeling that I am going to have to tone down my actual thesis work as it would probably take me more than a year to complete what is actually proposed in the thesis.   I also feel like I will be at school doing lots of work over the next couple of months getting it edited to just the right amount - I feel like editing is a job which is never done, and I could actually work on getting it just right for a long time.

November, while also being <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nanowrimo.org%2F&amp;ei=Z6EuR5uyIoHSgQS34eymBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE19m3qROIAHNcjKuJocVs9THCOow&amp;sig2=zHFGltYidHuIDFzWURpkkg">NaNoWriMo</a>, is <a href="http://www.fussy.org/2006/10/nablowrimo.html">NaBloWriMo</a>, which is focused on people writing in their blogs.  I like this idea because it's much more casual and easier to do.  Writing my thesis has shown me that it's pretty easy to write 500 words a day, and I feel like that's about the perfect size for a blog post, so I will probably try to keep each post around 500 words, without pastes and pictures and the like.   So look to see a bunch more posts from me - I already need to catch up, I'm 4 posts behind.  Diana is also doing the NaBloWriMo, but she is actually doing it on both of her blogs: <a href="http://www.magickalrealism.com">Magickal Realism</a>, the one for her business, and <a href="http://fatchic.dianarajchel.com">Fat Chic</a>, her fashion blog.   I hope she can get her posts written, and it works out okay.

In the past I have tried to post once every other day, and that didn't work out very well, even though I had a bunch of ideas which were floating around waiting for a blog post.  After a while I figured that I just only had a certain amount of writing in me per day, so while I was trying to power out my 500 words a day for the thesis, I couldn't really blog.  It was a pretty bad excuse, but it worked for me because honestly the blog is less important than the thesis.  It might happen again, especially if I am spending a lot of time honing the thesis down to the bare minimum.  That would be okay though, it'll just be the norm for a NaNoWriMo attempt - a strong start and then not much useful at the end, and at least I'd be working hard on things that are important.
