Lately the e-ink and eBook readers have been gaining popularity, and the
price war has been heating up, with [Kindle dropping to $79][1] and
[Barnes and Noble following suit with price cuts][2].  It really is the next stage in
the book reading experience with finally the electronic readers being
in the "buy it to try it" price range.  Diana and I both have e-ink readers and
I like mine so much that I am actually considering getting another one
before this one is even a year old.  The e-ink is really nice on the
eyes, and it's nice to know that I can toss it in the bag and always
have someting interesting to read.   The Kindle itself is enhanced
completely by [Instapaper][3] which is a kind of way to port the
_tldr_ reading on the web to a format where I'm actually more apt to
sit down and go through it.  It also has the advantage of splitting
the content from the ads most of the time.

Because I like to read books on the Kindle for many reasons, usually
when I am surfing around and I see a book recommendation, I'll check
it out and see if it's available for the e-readers that we have in the
house.  As [Marco Arment][4], creator of Instapaper and [ad-hoc e-ink
reader reviewer][5] noted recently, the [library advantage of
Amazon has been going away recently][6].

The thing that annoys and confuses me lately is that the Kindle price
is most often several dollars **more** than the cost of getting a
paper copy delivered to my door.  Let's look at the same books that
Marco looked at:

<table>
<tr> <th> Book </th> <th> Kindle </th> <th> Physical (new) &amp; Type </th> </tr>
<tr> <td> Walter Isaacson: Steve Jobs                   </td> <td> $14.99 </td> <td> $17.88 Hardcover </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Steven King: On Writing                       </td> <td> $12.99 </td> <td> $10.88 Paperback </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Nicholas Sparks: The Best of Me               </td> <td> $12.99 </td> <td> $10.19 Paperback </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> Steve Hagen: Buddhism Plain and Simple        </td> <td> $9.99  </td> <td> $9.60  Paperback </td> </tr>

</table>

In more than half of the 11 cases where you can buy the book on the kindle, it is actually cheaper for me to get a new physical
copy that I can carry around, and more importantly, I can [give away or resell later][8].  These aren't even the most aggregious that
I have seen in my searching, since they are skewed toward some newer books.   If we really want to go crazy, some of these
books are available at the bargain price of $.01 (plus $3.99 shipping of course), which is **less than half** of the cost of the
Kindle book if I'm willing to get it in the horribly used state of "Acceptable".
Something is wrong with this model - it is encouraging me to buy the book in a form which is less convenient for me, certainly more cost
to the publisher, worse for the environment, and most paradoxically at more cost to Amazon itself.  
Amazon doesn't like this of course, most of the ones where it's cheaper to get the copy physically have displayed prominently
_This price was set by the publisher_.
It's becoming clear to me that once these lower prices start making e-readers more ubiquitous, the competition isn't
the Kindle versus other readers, who have all almost have a price parity nowadays, but versus the physical copies of their own books.
