Okay this turned out very long. Learning LJ-Cut time...

<h3>The Strangest Dream Ever</h3>
I had the stangest dream of my life last night.  I don't remember too much of it, as I usually forget them, but this one was especially wierd.  I was living in my same apartment, but for some reason I had a roommate.  I woke and took a shower, while listening to the radio like I usually do (I actually listen to NPR's newscast in the morning on the web) when the fire alarm went off in the building.  Of course I did what I would normally do in this situation, ignore the alarm and continue to shower.  As I'm finishing, I vaguely hear things about terrorists on the radio over the alarm.  I get out of the shower and start drying off, and then realize that there are 2 armed, uniformed men in my bathroom (how we all fit in there is beyond me).  They tell me that the alarm is a terrorist alarm, and I just kindof nonchalantly say 'okay' and go to get dressed, but as I reach for some undergarments, there are 2 vicious squirrels IN my underwear!  Of course this is when I wake up.

I think back at the dream and wonder if my mind is trying to tell me something. Mabye this is my body's way of telling me that squirrels are going to try and take over the planet.

<h3>Watching way too much anime</h3>
I made a huge dent in my anime debt last night.  I watched some Daa Daa Daa, Airmaster, Cinderella Boy, Full Metal Alchemist, Shingetsuan Tsukihime, Yawara!, Konjiki no Gash Bell, Ocha-ken, Chrno Crusade, and Condor Hero.  Shingetsuan Tsukihime ended well, not in the kind of happy-ending-disney sort of way that lots of anime end up.   Condor Hero is proving to still be the best old-style martial arts anime out there.  Konjiki was surprisingly plot-ful as opposed to it's normal hooliganistic humor, a good contrast to the last episode ("Muteki Folgore!").  Cinderella Boy finished, and boy am I glad -- that series was very horrible.  If I wasn't such an anime addict, I would have stopped watching it a long time ago.   Anyway with all these series finishing, I will probably get to use my DVD burner again sometime this week.  One of the bonuses of having a DVD burner is that you only need to use it every two weeks or so, instead of all the time, as my old CD-RW drive got used.  It feels so nice to be able to clear out 4.3GB of stuff at once.

<h3>My Diet</h3>
In other news, my diet isn't going exactly as planned.  While this looks great overall, the flattening at the end is what bugs me.  Oh, and that huge space right before December?  That's all of November missing from my chart.  I have no doubt that I threw it away because I had been all the way through December already.  I really did weigh myself and write it down, but I have no clue where it went.  At any rate you can see I didn't really lose any poinds during that month anyway.  The sizable other chunk missing is the christmas holiday, which I am perfectly fine missing, and I surprisingly didn't gain weight over.

I'll probably stop writing in LJ sometime in the near future, since I don't really want to pay, and I have a perfectly good site of my own to work with.  Mabye I'll see if I can make my site work with LogJam or something, or add comments. Comments are cool.  I'll probably keep this account around anyway, just so I can keep track of some LJ people I know.
