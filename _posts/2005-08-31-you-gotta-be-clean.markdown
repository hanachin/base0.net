Moving is coming along as expected.  The apartment looks really bare now, and that's to be expected since we are moving tomorrow.  I'm nervous mostly because I don't know when the movers are coming - hopefully they will show up sometime around 2pm, instead of some time around 11am.  I love it when important things like movers are scheduled for a three-hour window.

In order to ease my mind, and get things done quicker in the morning, I present a list of things (ordered this time, as this is the order I must finish them in) which I must do tomorrow:
<!--break-->
<ol>
	<li> Pack microwave, Wok</li>
	<li> Dissassemble kitchen table</li>
	<li> Take out trashbags</li>
	<li> Pack Bathroom Stuff</li>
	<li> Drive Di's Car up to side door</li>
	<li> Load up Di's Car with things we're definitely transporting ourselves (mostly computers and important documents)</li>
	<li> Load up the rest of Di's car with other stuff we don't mind hauling ourselves and fits</li>
	<li> Attempt to move things which are being professionally moved into living room</li>
	<li> Random cleaning</li>
</ol>
I've been testing a drupal installation today.  I don't have it themed yet, but the setup is <a href="http://launchpad.base0.net">here</a>.   Until it gets themed and takes over, I'll be mirroring posts both here and there.
