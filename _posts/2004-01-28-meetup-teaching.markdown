Went to the LJ <a href="http://livejournal.meetup.com">meetup</a> last night. <a href="http://zedd.livejournal.com">zedd</a>, <a href="http://silvrayn.livejournal.com">silvrayn</a>, <a href="http://miss_jones.livejournal.com">miss_jones</a>, <a href="http://sparkledrop.livejournal.com">sparkledrop</a>, <a href="http://amagadlyn.livejournal.com">amagadlyn</a>, <a href="http://joceiphus.livejournal.com">joceiphus</a>, <a href="http://sugarbeet.livejournal.com">sugarbeet</a>, and Ben (who I think is now <a href="http://want_a_be.livejournal.com">want_a_be</a>) were there.  It was a fun time, went around the room with everyone's jobs and passing around anecdotal stories about Minneapolis, Driving, and other stuff.  <a href="http://zedd.livejournal.com">zedd</a> gets the "HARDCORE" award for driving from Rochester.  Afterwards I was getting pretty hungry, so we dropped off Ben and headed to the IHOP with joceiphus.  Yummy breakfast food was had by all.

I get to teach the 1901 (Structure of Computer Programming I a.k.a. Beginning Programming) this Friday.  I'm pretty excited, but I haven't taught students who are this green before anything, unless you count the lab/discussion that I lead last summer.  I think I'm going to get to teach them the joy of special forms like "if" and "and" and "or" and the meaning behind them being a special form and not a combination.  We'll see how far the professor gets today.
