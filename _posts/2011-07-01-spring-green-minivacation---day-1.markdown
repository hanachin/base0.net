It's been a while since I've had a vacation, and one of the presents
I gave Diana this valentines was a trip to see the [American Players
Theater](http://americanplayers.org/) which is centered in
[Spring Green, Wisconsin](http://www.springgreen.com/).  There
are also a bunch of other tourist-friendly things around that area and
Diana enjoys the place, so we decided to take a mini-vacation over an
extended Independence Day weekend.

Our first day was a travel day, and our first long trip in the Yaris that we
got last year since Christmas.  Most of the trips that we take are long enough
that we are travelling by plane and leaving the car at home.  Since I knew I
wasn't going to be getting my normal exercise while on vacation, I got up early
and did a walk around the neighborhood.  Lately I've been listening to the
[Critical Hit
Podcast](http://www.majorspoilers.com/category/major-spoilers-podcast/critical-hit)
while I exercise, because when I have 5 days of exercise a week, I quickly run
out of podcasts.  Usually I find something to listen to a long backlog so that
I don't run out of entertainment.  I had a good walk and then we got ready to
go.

The [drive to Spring Green](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=44.078145,-91.638375&spn=2.197918,5.39978&t=h&z=8) was pretty nice.   It was very hot
outside, which made us very thankful for the air conditioning in the
car, which actually works quite well in our tiny car, and didn't seem
to impact the mileage that much.  The last part of the trip took us
off of the highway and through some of the highways around the country
in Wisconsin, going through some of the tiniest towns that I have seen
in a while.  It made me think about how these tiny towns actually pay
for things, because they have some pretty nice streets and like
streetlights (well, one streetlight) in some of them.  Regardless,
there was some nice views on the way to the hotel.

We're staying at the [Usonian Inn](http://usonianinn.com), which is unique in the world for
being the only motel which is built in the [Usonian style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usonian) of
architecture.   Looking at it makes you think that it is not really
nice on the outside (although that is debatable), but it looks very
nice on the inside and is quite
interesting with lots of straight lines.  Even with the small room that we
picked, there are a lot of interesting elements.  I [took some
pictures](https://picasaweb.google.com/jamuraa/UsonianInn2011?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCKWVrv2M_MrEKA&feat=directlink).   The hotel itself is also a very eco-friendly hotel,
and is one of the only ones in the areas which is kept on a couple of
the green registries.   While it's a little more expensive than a
run-of-the-mill hotel, I think I would stay there again.

After we got situated, we wanted to get something to eat, so we drove
along the road looking for stuff.  We did a little random driving and
went through another tiny town -- [Lone Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Rock,_Wisconsin) -- which was a little depressing
because there wasn't much there.  After we got through the town we
drove over a couple of nice bridges though which took us over a river
(which was quite high) and a drive along a cliff which provided some
quite nice views of the Wisconsin countryside.

We ended up in [Dodgeville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgeville,_Wisconsin) to get some grub and some vacation
supplies.  We ate at one of the last remaining [Country Kitchen](http://www.countrykitchenrestaurants.com/)s
which are rare nowadays.  We overheard from the hostess that there
was quite the scandal with the CEO or someone high up at the company
got convicted for embezzlement and all of the company owned stores had
to be closed, leaving only the franchise stores left.  There are only
a few left - less than 40 I think was the number they said.  All of
the franchise stores are individually up for sale as well I think she
said.  It was interesting to hear of this story which impacted quite a
large chain of restaurants.

I had some ribs and fries which were just what I needed since I had
only had some cheese curds since breakfast.  It being a vacation, I'm
letting myself eat freely instead of trying to be strict to the super
low carb [ketogenic diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet) that I am normally eating.  To that end, I
ended up getting some sweets for dessert and munching on as well.  I'm
hoping that it doesn't make a big impact on the scale when I get back
on July 4.  I'll be going on an extreme carb cut for the first couple
days of next week, trying to go actually zero carbs to see how
quickly I can start burning the fat.

After some supplies, we were both very tired, so we went back to the
hotel and plugged in everything to recharge and watched a little TV
before drifting off to sleep.  Friday is the day where we will have a
full day to spend in Spring Green and see the play in the evening.  We
might end up going to some other spots, or put them off until
Saturday.  It's set to be another over-90 day pretty much all day
long, so maybe not.  Until then.
