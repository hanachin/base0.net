Apparently the best way to lose friends on LJ is to
1. start a separate blog that can post to LJ
2. stop posting things about your life
3. start posting lots of movie and book reviews.

People on LJ - I'm defriending people who I see rarely in real life and have also defriended me.

In other news, my new blog is being syndicated in full glory at <a href="http://planet.debian.org">Planet Debian</a>.  Wondering how the debian folks will like the movie reviews and general ramblings.
