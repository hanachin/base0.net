Okay so now I'm sitting at Triple Rock, typing this on my new  iBook (yay for new toys). We just ordered food and I'm at an  interesting policital discussion group with. Amy is talking  with Sarah's mom about her car.

The group had homework this month, to find out what you actually care about on the issues.  You were supposed to come up with 5 things that you care about  outside of your personal life. I have serious issues coming up  with these issues, because I really don't care too much about  things that don't effect my life on a daily basis. So this  means that my list of things consists of (in no particular  order):
<ul>
	<li>Public transit</li>
	<li>Intellectual Property / Consumer Rights in the Modern Age</li>
	<li>Education concerns</li>
</ul>
This is only 3 items, you notice, because I don't really have  anything else I care about that isn't personal - at least things  that I actually care about.

This group is now semi-officially called "junta" (pronounced  "who-nta") which means something in spanish that I can't really  recall right now.

Okay, I'm typing this because I need a sufficiently long piece  of text in order to text out the layout that I am creating for  a livejournal/web page. One of the issues I have with  LiveJournal is that you can't use the domain redirection with  people being logged in at the same time. It would be cool if  you could just go to a random page (www.base0.net in this  case) and not have to worry about "am I logged in?" - it would  be cool to see the friends-only entries show up on sites that I  visit. Not that I really read other people's pages by their journal entries on their actual journals anyway. That is  probably why this is an exercise in futility - most people won't  even see this page. The important page is the comments page -  people will click on their page to leave a comment or view the comments and then they will see your style.

Paul is talking about how there are a lot of sexy women on the news and there are not many sexy women in the commercials.  Sarah talks about how there are more car commercials on local news than national news - lots of investment commercials on the  national news. She found that very interesting. Sarah's mom  makes a boomers comment.

Billy suggests breaking up the bill evenly. Some guy in a blue hoodie (Amy says that it's Noah or Zach) says that he's staying for  some alcohol and suggests we split that too. No seconds.
