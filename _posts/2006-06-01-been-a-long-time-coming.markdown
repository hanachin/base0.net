Life has taken a turn for the busy lately, which means of course that this space loses a lot of content.  Things have slowed down a bit now.  Things which were taking up my time before were being basically one of the only technical staff for ICRA2006 (with one other who helped enormously), a new job at Honeywell Labs, and actually getting some research done on my thesis.

ICRA2006 was basically amazing and horrible at the same time.  The amazing parts: meeitng people who are famous (a.k.a. "respected in their field"), eating a ton of fancy food on the dime of the conference, being at the first conference of my academic career.  The horrible: working 18 hour days, being the go-to guy for practically everything, painful feet from walking most of those 18 hours.  All in all, the amazing outways the horrible by a long shot.  I also couldn't make it to DebConf6 because of it, and it was in a country that I might have actually made it to this time.  Next year I guess.

The new job at Honeywell is going decently.  We have a target in July which is probably going to have me pulling long hours.  The best thing about the new job is of course pay-related though - I am going to be consumer-debt free by the end of this year.  I hope that I can finish the nameless financial web application before my finances improve enough that I don't need it anymore.

I have narrowed in on my thesis more, which is an improvement at least.  Now I need to actually write papers and do research while avoiding too many duties in other areas.  I've got a couple of blog postings in the queue which should show up soon, and hopefully I will re-enable myself on Planet Debian.

I also bought a present for our apartment, and she hasn't guessed exactly what it is yet.  This is me taunting Di a <em>little</em>. :)
