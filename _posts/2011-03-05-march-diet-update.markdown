I've been thinking a lot lately about food, which is unsurprising because I'm *on
a diet* or whatever you would like to call it.  I'm calorie restricting, which
means that I am eating less calories than my body needs in order to force it to
use the fat reserves that it has accumulated over the years.  It occurs to me
now that I don't exactly know how many fat reserves I have in me, which would be
calculated using some type of body fat percentage.  I should probably get it
measured in some way - possibly as a reward for hitting an intermediate goal
(270?) I should go to a local place that has a [Bod
Pod](http://www.bodpod.com/) and find out exactly.

The feel of myself has been better in the last month or so, which I've been
happy with.  I don't know exactly when I started noticing it, but I've been
gradually getting too small for my pants, and I should really go out and buy some
new ones.  I really want to wait until I am at least one more size down though,
because I will then be out of the "extended sizes" that are offered by the
retailers and clothes will actually be cheaper.  I got some new work/casual
shirts a few weeks ago and they fit well enough, and I was happy about that.  I
also recently bought a new belt, not because the old one was too large (although
I have one of those), but because it had broken and lost a screw or something
holding it in.  The new one should last me while.

There is a question which has been on my mind quite a bit recently, because of
the steady progress over the last few months.  **What happens when I am done
losing weight?**  I know the *correct* answer to this question is that nothing
happens - you are meant to have changed your life forever by losing these
pounds, and you will need to be vigilant about your diet for the rest of your
life.  The problem is that I am unhappy with that response.  Seriously, I'm not
even at the point when I need to think about it yet, and I am actually
depressed.  It almost feels like I will be cheated out of all of the *hard work*
that I have put in to making myself thin, because there will be no end -- it's
just the button, you have to keep pressing the button, or you will gain weight
again and your life will be shit.

To that end, I've been thinking of supplementing the "cheat days" that are
built into my diet plan and alternating them with a new type of cheat day:
**Practice Days**.  On practice days, you should *not* keep track of the
calories that you eat throughout the day.  Try to eat "normally".  Eat when you
are hungry and then stop eating when you are full.  Order the amount of food
that you think is appropriate for how hungry you are, not because of how many
calories you think are in the meal.  This may mean that you actually avoid
eating at places that you go to frequently because you know how many calories
are in the sandwich.

After the practice day but within 48 hours, you should go back and think about
how you did on your practice day.  Attempt to estimate how many calories were
in the food that you ate, and compare it against your metabolic rate **not your
diet calorie target**.  You want to be right around the number that would keep
you at the weight that you are now, or maybe lower.  For me, that means that
practice days I can eat 1000 calories more than I would normally eat on my diet.
Sit and think about what diet decisions that you made that day, and how you
would make them differently in the future - but would still keep you happy with
the day as a whole.

I think for psychological eaters or people who have a mental imbalance that made
them fat in the first place, this will be very hard.  I'm planning on doing it
for a month or more, with the goal of them to have to not be in constant
vigilance about my diet when I am "done" losing weight.  If I succeed, I'll be
able to just eat when I want, because that's what my body will tell me it wants,
and what my mind will tell me it wants too.

My chart for the last 30 days is looking pretty good.  I am happy with my
progress.  There was one day where I was above the trend line, but I am still on
a steady decline.  I would like to be closer to 2 pounds per week, but I can
live with the numbers that I'm putting up now.  The calorie deficit means that
if I want to hit the 2 pounds per week goal, I should short what my calorie
counting website is telling me by about 200 calories.  I'll try that for a few
weeks.

This time, the yearly chart is telling me that I am losing faster than during
the month.  It's pretty nice to see this one, that I have lost 15 pounds since
the beginning of the year.  The fitted line shown, if I keep it up, means that I
will be at my goal of 250 around July.  That is my next major milestone, and I
want to actually re-evaluate my decisions around weight around then, and
actually think about where the "done" point is.
