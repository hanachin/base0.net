There came a point in my day today when I wanted to watch some anime, so I decided to sit down and do just that.  I get into my chair and realize that my feet are cold because I took my socks off, so I decided to watch laying in bed instead in hopes of warming them.  I warmed myself a little too much, and ended up sleeping from 5pm to 7pm.  This would normally be fine, but this weekend I stayed up until 4am for three days in a row, and I was really hoping to fix my sleep cycle today.  In other news, I discovered how to join communities in lj.  I should really set a picture on here as well, but the end of Shingetsuan Tsukihime is calling to me, and my stomach is ready for a chicken breast that I've been thawing specifically for 12 hours for it.
