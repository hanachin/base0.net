I've been a bit lax in the updates on the diet that I normally post
monthly.  I have some good news to report and then a new challenge for
the future.  The hard part starts now.

The last two months have been a continued vigilance of what I am
eating, and how much I am eating specifically, and my weight has been
reflecting it.  I didn't reach my goal before the vacation that I was
hoping for in the [August update][1], but the first international
travel that I made after this whole thing started was a lot more
comfortable this time than it was before.  The airplane seats were
marginally more comfortable, and there was nothing that I was really
regretting about the whole thing.  The seats are still too small for
me, because I am a tall as well as a big guy still.

The low-carb diet itself has gone completely out of the window lately.
I wasn't even trying to keep it while I was on vacation, and I
kind of kept not keeping it after we returned from the vacation.  I
have still been keeping track of my calories when I can, and trying to
overestimate when I can't keep track of what exactly I am eating.  It
continually is a struggle, because Diana is a great cook, and we have
a comfortable enough life that we can go out to eat at least a couple
of times a week.  These meals are really fun to go to, but are the
hardest to budget for on my diet because rarely do they include
nutritional information on the menu, and most likely not even on the
website for some of the more local places that we like to frequent.
The calorie counting is doing okay for me still except for these types
of meals that I can't keep track of.  If I have some warning that I'll
be having one of these "untrackable" meals, I'll try to eat
significantly less throughout the day to make up for it.

The big news for this month is that I've succeeded at my first stage
goal for weight loss.  I now weigh less than 230 pounds fairly
consistently over the last few weeks.  This means that I am 110 pounds
lighter than when I started focusing on weight loss almost 22 months
ago.  Right now, I'm planning on making this a stopping point in my
weight loss, and trying to maintain my weight at this stage until the
end of the year at least.  This means that I will be upping my
calories, and actually eating more, and also replacing a bunch of my
clothes as they were getting comically large on me at this point.
I'll still be tracking my calories as closely as I can.  I've been
promising a more up to date picture, and some of them leaked out last
month during the vacation, but here is one from today, juxtaposed with
one from last summer - not exactly the start of my diet, but close
enough.

That looks pretty good, partially because I was actually eating in the
first picture, but I can't really find a better "before" picture for myself.
The [before][2] and [after][3] pictures are available in full size too.
I'm also wearing my new jeans in this picture, which are size 38.
Compared to my old size I've lost about 10 inches.   The shirt I'm
wearing is a size Large, and the before picture I'm wearing a 3XL shirt.
It's pretty great, but feels strange when I'm wearing clothes that are
so small now.

So I've decided that I'm done trying to lose weight, and will try to
maintain my current weight until the end of the year.   I've started
already by increasing my calorie budget by 500 calories.  Technically
that's still a diet, because I was cutting 1000 calories below BMR
before, but I don't want to overshoot and start gaining weight again.
I'm going to keep it at this level and then reevaluate whether I am
losing or gaining and adjust as necessary.

More importantly, there is another goal that I will be focusing on
from now until then is my fitness.  I've been exercising all through
this diet trek in order to give myself some headroom on calories, but
now I'm doing it in order to get a bit more fit.   My first goal is
focused on running.  I've been running around the neighborhood,
keeping [this running course][4] so that I can measure my progress.
I've been getting faster lately, with my best pace being [10:30 per
mile][5] which was just about a week ago.  That's about a minute per
mile pace gain since August.

Last month I ended up skipping the update, mostly because I was just
lazy, but this month the graph looks good.  Last month looked pretty
good as well.  You can see some of the stability at the end of the
graph once I hit the 230 goal that I have been working towards.
I'm hoping that I can keep that line straight or going slightly down
in the next report that I end up posting.

The yearly graph still looks great.  There are only a couple of
extended red areas, which both correspond to vacations.  These graphs
have been keeping me on track, even though I only look at them once a
month.  The daily deficit is based on the best-fit line that is shown
here, and fed into my idea that I shouldn't be too hasty to increase
back to the BMR.

So there's my first intermediate goal met.  If I am still at or under
230 at the end of the year, I'll claim victory and re-evaluate my
health and my goals for my body for the 2012 year.  I'm still somewhat
not happy when I look at myself, but my fitness goal I think might
help with that a bit by reshaping my body a little more instead of
just making it smaller.  If you're interested in tracking my progress,
