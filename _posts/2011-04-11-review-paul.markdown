I went to see Paul this weekend with Diana, and we were treated to a
completely empty theater.  It seems kind of strange whenever this
happens, like everyone else got tipped to a really bad review or
something.  To add to the confusion, during the previews the vertical
stabilization or something went off on the projector, and it was
jostling up and down giving me a headache.  I missed the opening
titles.  Despite these hiccups, the movie was quite enjoyable.

Paul is a movie about a couple of english guys played by the often
seen together [Simon Pegg](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0670408/) and [Nick Frost](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0296545/), who also did 
{{ "B002HR1W1K" | amazon_link }} and 
{{ "B0025VLEM0" | amazon_link }} together.  They play classic sci-fi geeks who are
going to comic con and then taking a extended RV trip to all of the famous places
in conspiracy culture, like [Area
51](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51) and the [black
mailbox](http://www.dreamlandresort.com/area51/mailbox.html),
While they are on their way, a mysterious black sedan crashes in front
of them and they are introduced to Paul (voiced by [Seth
Rogen](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0736622/)), a
little green alien who is rude, unexpected, and has mysterious powers.
He is also running from the law.

The rest of the movie follows them running from two sets of mysterious
and funny agents,
played quite well by strong supporting actors [Jason
Bateman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000867/), [Bill
Hader](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352778/) and
[Joe Lo Truglio](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0516266/).  A chase across the country and some zany
situations follow, and a couple of twists near the end keep the whole
thing interesting.

I felt like Paul got a slow start, but it really worked it's way into
a groove and soon the laughs were coming regularly.  Cledd and Pegg
play against each other well, and the situations they get a little
into the unbelievable, but the alien addition to the cast make the
whole thing work really well.  There's also a lot of callbacks that
are funny to the die-hard sci-fi fan, but out of the way to the person
who wouldn't notice it.  An example is the cantina band song from Star
Wars being played in a country-western manner in one scene.  It
enhances the movie for those in the know but the whole scene is still
hilarious without being tipped off.

Going out of this movie, I found myself unhappy that we were the only two who
were seeing it that night - it certainly deserves to have an audience.
I'd rate it at a **7**.
