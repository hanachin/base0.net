From [faces above ground][1] last time, we switch to below ground faces this time.
I'm not quite easy to know what to say though.

This is just a random cave face carving, which I can't really say much
about.  The [source image][2] isn't that much help, it just says
carving of a face in the description.

So I was looking for some cave carvings, and I thought about the
[Mayans][3], who had some pretty [elaborate cave carvings][4].  They
don't really look the same though.  There have been a lot of people
talking about the Mayans recently because of their calendar.  There
are [quite a few][5] carvings of the calendar that you can find around
the web.  People say that it predicts the [end of the world][6] in
2012, but I'm not convinced.   At any rate, that looks like a dead end
anyway.

So I was wondering about some of the other cave carvings, and I
remembered that there were quite a lot of carvings and statues in the
[Indian mountains][7].  These are mostly [statues though][8].  Lots of
them are of the [Hindu Gods and Goddesses][9], of which there are a lot.  There are
at least 33 different [vedas][10] described in the [Rig Veda][11],
but some people say that there could be 330 million gods.  Even others
would say that 330 million was just supposed to be a impossibly large
number (like a [hojillion][12]), and it really meant infinity.  Again
though, those statues don't look a lot like the crude carving that you
see above, in fact they are quite intricate, so I continued my search.

I hit up Google for just a random search of cave face paintings, and I
found another path that I investigated in [Hellfire caves][13] in
Britain.  There are some strange rooms in these caves, and one of the
rooms has quite a few [faces carved in chalk][14].  These look a
little more like the picture above, but I think that they are probably
a bit more recent, and they are in white, not the distinctive brownish
rock that you see in the source picture.  Some of them do [look quite
similar though][15].

I think this is the first solid picture that I just don't have a good
handle on.  I kept looking for a while, but I didn't find much else.
There was [one cave in Australia][16] which had a very similar color
and a face which was similar, but it looks like my search was
fruitless.  I may come back and try to search out the photographer of
this later, to see if I can find something more.
