We're continuing to zoom out into bigger and bigger viewpoints through these first seven images
in the flashing montage at the beginnign of the show.  Today we are seeing some amphibians, just like 
the [last image](http://base0.net/posts/big-bang-theory-intro-6-leaving-the-sea):

</a>

This image again is available in source form, and in color, through [Jupiter Images](http://www.jupiterimages.com/Image/royaltyFree/87561341). 
The title of the image is "Marine iguanas on rocks", which is exactly what this image depicts.
[Marine Iguanas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_iguana) are unique in the world, and are only found near
the Galapagos islands.  It relates really closely to the image from last week, because it can forage and live
off of the sea, not needing any of the things on the land.   This image might be the first hint of a slant
(other than the obvious timeline with billions of years) towards an evolutionary angle, as they were commented
on by [Charles Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) when he was on his visit to the Galapagos.

They are protected by the Equadorian government, and are considered threatened by many becuase their food
source is affected and these rocks that they bask on in order to raise their
temperature (they are cold-blooded or course) are both affected by the [El Nino
effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENSO).
