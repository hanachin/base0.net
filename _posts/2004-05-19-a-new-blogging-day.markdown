  I think that I finally have PyBloxsom the way that I want it. reStructuredText entries are working, which is nice, because then I
  don't have to type annoying HTML all the time.  The layout is new, and working out good, and I have the custom plugin in order to make the side menu you see over there work just right.  It puts the most recent three titles of entries over there, just for fun.  Anyway, I'm hoping that I can organize things a little better this way, and also get things syndicated that some people want and others don't.

Hoping to make a /debian which is syndicated to <a href="http://planet.debian.net">Planet Debian</a>.   I just need to get the
fake categories plugin I found <a href="http://raw.no/pyblosxom/plugins/fakecat.py">here</a> working.
