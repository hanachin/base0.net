Went to <a href="http://peaches_phd.livejournal.com">peaches_phd</a>'s place with <a href="http://silvrayn.livejournal.com">silvrayn</a> and <a href="http://want_a_be.livejournal.com">want_a_be</a> for a superbowl thingy.  The game was surprisingly fun to watch this time.  It could have been a lot worse than it was, and it's always great when it comes down to the last seconds.  The commercials weren't bad either - you can <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/?sctn=collections&pg=superbowl2004">see them</a> if you missed them.  I particularly like the Pepsi Music Download one and the Linux one - although you might have guessed that.  There seemed to be a bunch of trailers this year, but it could just be my imagination.

After the game we hung around and I drunk some more (with some egging on by silvrayn needed) and watched the premiere of that new survivor thing, even though it will be impossible for me to watch it since I teach on Thursday nights when it shows, oh, and the fact that I don't own a TV.  It was a pretty fun time.  Good gumbo was had by all, and friends of peaches_phd kept showing up which was interesting.  Serious snowstorms occurred, otherwise I'm sure there would have been more people around.

Time to curl up into a warm bed and sleep now though.
