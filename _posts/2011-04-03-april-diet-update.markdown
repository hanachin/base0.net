So the diet has been going pretty well this month, I've been keeping to my
calorie counts more and also not having as much of an issue with keeping the
weight off.  There are less ups and downs and that is a good thing.  I still
have some days when I weigh mysteriously three pounds more than I did the day
before, despite only eating the prescribed amounts.  I'm doing pretty good at
just letting it go by though.

My daily diet has changed a little since the last time that I wrote.   I cut all
of the carbs out of my breakfast about halfway through March, partially to lower
the caloric content of the meal, and partly because I was planning on trying a
low-carb diet starting this month.  I've started and been on the diet a week or
so right now, and it's been pretty good.  Most days I'm trying to figure out how
I can get to my calorie limit instead of seeing how I can get under it.
Especially on days when I am exercising, I usually have to down an ounce or
three of peanuts to make my calorie deficit goal.

Speaking of the exercise, it's been pretty good to get back to it after taking
the month of February off.  I'm going five days a week for thirty minutes now,
and that seems to be a sweet spot for me in terms of time taken and enjoyent.
One of the things that I was really unhappy during exercise in the winter was
the hour long sessions really dragged on my psyche.  I always would be thinking
about what I could be doing instead of exercising.  I re-started with thirty
minute sessions instead which was a great call - they are much easier to fit
into a day because if I only have an hour free I can still fit in a workout, and
I don't have an issue finishing them.  I also feel a lot more accomplished when
I go a little extra, going 40 minutes or 45 minutes.

I don't remember the exact cheat days that I took in March, but I'm sure that I
was on form.  It took a little bit longer to institute the "practice days" that
I talked about last month - I had my first one last weekend as I was on a short
day trip out of town.  I ate like a "normal" day and ordered off the menu as if
I wasn't on a special diet and wasn't sweating the calories.  I think I came in
just under the amount of calories I wanted.

I've been thinking lately that it's more important how you feel about how you
ate on the practice day instead of how you actually did on the calories.  I know
that when I was having too much food at lunch and then again having too much
food at dinner, I was actually not happy with myself when I was finishing the
meal, but I would keep on going because I wanted to finish the food that I had
ordered, and I didn't want to waste something.  Alternately I was unhappy an
hour later or later in the day when I was eating my dinner but realizing that I
wasn't actually hungry and I was just eating because it was good to eat with my
wife for a dinner.  It is most important to me on those practice days that I
don't have those feelings at all.  Secondary feelings to avoid would be the ones
where I feel over-full, like I have had too much to eat.  I used to have that
feeling all the time, and I barely ever have it now except on cheat days and
practice days.

The thirty day graph looks good from here.  It's the best weekly loss number
since I've started making these posts monthly.  I'm dangerously close to the two
pounds a week that I've been trying to hit since I've started logging my weight
again.  I'm also doing it by hitting my calorie goal now and not shorting it by
200 like I mentioned last month.  That's fine.  I only had a day or two above
the trend line, although I got closea few times.

The yearly chart looks pretty damn good as well.  You can really see the
trendline take the dip that I was hoping during the end of March.  There is
a nice number at the bottom of the y-axis too, I'm hovering around 270 now,
making the mini goal that I had made before.  I'm hoping to be hovering around
260 when I make the next report.  I'm still aiming for 250 by the middle of this
year, and then I will be making the big decisions about whether I'm stopping at
that number, or if I will keep going.  I never really had some solid goals when
I started this whole thing, except for being a healthier person in general.
