One of the earliest signs of artistic expression is next on our list - it's painting!

[Cave paintings][1] have been around for a long time.  Really, a long,
long time.  The earliest cave paintings have been dated to over 32,000
years ago!  That's a lot longer ago than the Big Bang Theory timeline
suggests, and far before our previous scene of [The Wheel][2].  These
are all out of order.

No one really knows the purpose of cave paintings.  I always thought
that they were some way of storytelling, but some of them don't make
sense, because they are tucked away really deep into some caves, in
places where there aren't any signs of habitation.  Some have
suggested that they might have been used in some type of religious
ceremony.

It's also been recently thought that the paintings weren't made in one
session, but instead added on to throughout the years, some taking
[over 20,000 years to complete][3].  I love the idea of people
stopping in a cave while being the migratory people that they are, and
finding a painting which is partially done, and then adding on to what
they saw.  It hearkens to some type of [Noble Savage][4] impulse in my
mind.

This would also be the first image in the opening sequence to have a
female human subject - the figures on the left side are definitely of
the chesty variety.  I look and wonder what the heck they are doing
though.  The one on the bottom seems to be fulfilling some sort of
either ammo restocking, or possibly waving something around to
distract the hunted prey so that it is easier to shoot.  


The one on
the top is definitely giving someone [the finger][5], suggesting it
might be even more universal than I previously thought.  Maybe M.I.A.
was just trying to educate everyone about how old the gesture is. 
Apparently [Diogenes of Athens][6] used it in 4th century B.C.  Then
again, most Europeans are more likely to use [two fingers][7].
