title: Researching Parties..
excerpt: Well, last night I went out to chuck's place to party with the whole lab gang.  We watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117802/">Swingers</a> and partook of a lot of alcohol.  Actually, I think there was more partaking of alcohol and lively conversation than there was of watching the movie.  It was loads of fun - I'm sure pics will be posted by <a href="http://silvrayn.livejournal.com">silvrayn</a>, who was also there (or maybe even <a href="http://want_a_be.livejournal.com">want_a_be</a>, who hasn't even used his LJ account yet).

Well, last night I went out to chuck's place to party with the whole lab gang.  We watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117802/">Swingers</a> and partook of a lot of alcohol.  Actually, I think there was more partaking of alcohol and lively conversation than there was of watching the movie.  It was loads of fun - I'm sure pics will be posted by <a href="http://silvrayn.livejournal.com">silvrayn</a>, who was also there (or maybe even <a href="http://want_a_be.livejournal.com">want_a_be</a>, who hasn't even used his LJ account yet).  I invited <a href="http://amagdalyn.livejournal.com">amagdalyn</a> and she came along and drove, which was very cool.  I had far too much Guiness - 4 extra stout and 1 bottle.  It didn't get me as drunk as it did fill me up - I was definitely not sober by the end of the night though.

I've been feeling like I should do more work lately, which is most likely a good thing.  I have to figure out exactly what in robotics I'm planning on doing my thesis on, and that means basically reading papers and books to kingdom come.  I shouldn't have a huge problem with that because this semester is not too hard classes-wise.

I get to give the Pioneer robot intro speech again tomorrow like I did last semester.  Apparently I'm the go-to guy for it now, which doesn't bother me really, but I haven't used the robots in almost a year now.  I'm excited to stand in front of a class and teach again though.
