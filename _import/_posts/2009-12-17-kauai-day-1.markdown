Well, we have finally tied the knot, and now we are on our honeymoon.  It feels great to be here at all.   The first day was of course mostly taken up by flying from place to place, on our way here, and then taking the hour long drive to the condo.  I'm going to call that Day 0 because it doesn't really involve anything other than travelling.  We checked out the internet (cable modem, not bad) and went to sleep after finding some groceries which were quite expensive.  After a pleasant sleep in the condo, we were happy to wake up to a beautiful view:

The ocean extended out into the horizon, and we sat on the patio (lanai) to eat breakfast which today was cereal with milk.  It is quite relaxing and especially knowing that I didn't have anything really planned for the day.  We decided to make this a little excursion day, finding the nearest large-ish town and looking around.  We drove down to Hanalei which is the nearest town of any size.  The road down is pretty steep and includes a one-lane bridge, saying something about how many people are around here often.  It is obviously one of the less-populated islands.  Hanalei itself is a fairly small town which borders a very large beach.  I would estimate that it is about the same size as Pella, Iowa.. maybe a little larger.  It's hard to gauge because it is very spread out along the beach.   We stopped for some lunch and looked around the shops for a while.  Then I bought some sunglasses because I lose every pair that I own after a max of a week.

Afterwards we decided to explore the small condo complex that we are staying in.  The pool was found, and is open from 7am-7pm.  The hours are a little strange, but it is not lighted, so I guess it is better for the night to be swim-less and also accident-less.   I had heard about Sealodge Beach that is near the complex, accessible by trail and wanted to go down there.  The trail was marked with a sign saying that it was steep, slippery, and dangerous.  Thinking it was only to ward off liability, we started down the trail, which was immediately quite steep.  There was then a little creek and then a steep hill that we went both up and down the other side.  It was really like hiking through the jungle.  The path was quite beaten though so it was well-travelled at least.  After the hill we came to the ocean, where the coast is covered with huge porous lava rocks.   At this point we either took the wrong way, or the trail got a lot more treacherous.  It was very narrow and right along the dropoff which was rocky.  People with little hiking skill shouldn't really take the course.  I didn't realize until later how scary it was for Diana, and now I wish we hadn't gone farther than the first view of the ocean which was spectacular and much less scary.  When we finally could see the beach, we found our way to the end of the trail which was a quite large drop (&gt;4 feet) before the beach was accessible.  I think we either didn't see the right path, or we were supposed to take some other way down the rocks.   In any case, we didn't have the right footwear for this hike - we were both wearing our sandals at the time.   I think that Di got some good pictures of the hike before it got to the scary part.  We went back to the scenic look of the ocean and relaxed a while, and then again back to the condo from there with some rests.   We warned a couple off the trail who was also wearing sandals on the way down, and told another of how it got much harder down the way.  I also lost my newly-purchased sunglasses somewhere on the way back up, setting a new record of about 2 hours from buy to lose.  I'll need to buy another pair. I'm still thinking of trying to make it there again.  Knowing the way makes it a bit less scary, because you know that you can get there.  I don't think I can convince Diana to let me head down there though, she was very scared for our safety near the rocks.

After the hike to the beach, we relaxed for a little while and then decided to head for some dinner.  We drove again to Hanalei and spotted a pizza place called <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tiki-man-pizza-hanalei">Tiki Man Pizza</a>.  The wait was a bit long, there were apparently some large orders (the man mentioned something like 8 pizzas for one group) but it was worth it.  We had a pork pizza with pineapple and extra cheese.  It was some of the best pizza I've had in a long time.  The sauce had just a little sweet barbeque in it, which gave it a nice taste.  There was music at the bar next door as well, but it took a turn for the "frat boy" as Di put it, so we decided to go to another place for dessert and drinks.  We ended up heading to <a href="http://www.restaurantbaracuda.com/">Bar Acuda</a> which had an interesting atmosphere which seemed a bit more high-class.  We had some cocktails and wine and a nice dessert chocolate ice cream.

It being about 2am our time at this point, we headed back to the condo.  It started to sprinkle a little bit and we walked out on the lawn to see the <a href="http://www.kauaidiscovery.com/virtual_kauai_tour/hanalei+princeville+kilauea/Kilauea_Lighthouse/">Kilauea Lighthouse</a> flashing it's warning to boats (although we have seen exactly zero boats in the water off the coast so far).  The rain didn't come in the condo so we just left the windows open even though it could get a bit cold at night as we found out our first night.  Anyway that was Day 1.  We're headed to the lighthouse again today I think, and maybe to the beach to try some snorkeling and swimming, and relaxing.
