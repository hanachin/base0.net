title: Here comes the sun
excerpt: |-
  I can't tell you how pleased I was this morning to find out that the sun is now <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=55404&extendedsun=sunon">waking up</a> before I do.  I always enjoy my morning walk alot better when there's some rays piercing through the normal winter wonderland.  Winter would be great if we got more sun during these months.
  
  Going to the LJ meetup tonight with <a href="http://silvrayn.livejournal.com">silvrayn</a>.  I'll probably be meeting a bunch of people I didn't even know existed.

I had an unplanned nap yesterday.  I'm not sure if it was due to actual tiredness or if it was conditioned because I was attempting to read a paper whilst lying in bed - with the bed triggering some unconscious reaction making me sleepier.  Then again, it could just be a really boring paper.
