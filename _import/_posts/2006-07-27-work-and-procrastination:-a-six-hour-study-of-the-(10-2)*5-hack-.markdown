title: "Work and Procrastination: A six-hour study of the (10+2)*5 hack."
excerpt: "Recently I discovered the <a href=\"http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/11/procrastination-hack-1025/\">(10+2)*5 dash</a> courtesy of Merlin over at <a href=\"http://www.43folders.com\">43 Folders</a>, and I thought that I would give it a try.  The concept is fairly simple: work for 10 minutes, screw around for 2 minutes, repeat 5 times, and voila! you have filled an hour with 5/6 productivity."

Recently I discovered the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/11/procrastination-hack-1025/">(10+2)*5 dash</a> courtesy of Merlin over at <a href="http://www.43folders.com">43 Folders</a>, and I thought that I would give it a try.  The concept is fairly simple: work for 10 minutes, screw around for 2 minutes, repeat 5 times, and voila! you have filled an hour with 5/6 productivity.  The first thing that I did was download a <a href="http://www.widgetgallery.com/view.php?widget=28040">Konfabulator widget</a> which keeps track of the time and pops up a warning box when you should be screwing around and working.

I worked for approximately 6 hours under this regime today at my Honeywell job, even though I don't use task lists as diligently as I should there.  I found that tasks which I regarded as small were finishing in a snap, partly because I wanted to get them done before the next 2 minute break, and partly because if I didn't finish for a break, my mind didn't just stop thinking about the problem.  It was very advantageous to think about something else for 2 minutes and then get back to the action because it was like taking a fresh start.  I was using the dash to do some coding (the major portion of my hours right now) - finding bugs that normally would have me staring at the screen for a couple minutes seemed easy when I was just coming back from a break.  The only issues which I had with it was when I got interrupted by <a href="http://workrave.org">Workrave</a> rest breaks (I turned off microbreaks) or a coworker.  I am definitely doing it again, the next time I have an hour uninterrupted.
