Well, I'm in the middle of one of my thursdays.  They really suck for me because I have to get up at 6:30am in order to get in by 7:30am and prepare for the lab I'm teaching/monitoring at 8:00am.  When that finishes, I go to a really boring class lab (that I usually just surf the web during or do my own homework), and then another class which is only 25 minutes longer, but feels a lot longer on some days because there's no computer to waste the time when I'm bored.  I'm glad about the class though because when it's interesting, it's very interesting.  After that it's about 1pm, time for lunch, and then nothing at all until about 7pm, when I have another lab that I direct until 9pm.   It's the longest day that I have every week.   So now I'm just sitting at my desk typing into  LJ because I don't really have anything else that to do (or at least, nothing else I want to do - hooray for procrastination).

The only good part about Thursdays is that the next day is Friday.
