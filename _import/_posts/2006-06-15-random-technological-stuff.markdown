  <h3>Programming, windows style</h3>
  I'm now in the thick of a bunch of win32 programming at my Honeywell part-time job.  I don't mind it that much, but I continue to be amazed that Microsoft's IDE is still the one used most often.  The autocompletion is nice, but that's about the only good thing about it.  I am continually annoyed that the IDE doesn't know which definition of a function I want to use, and only seems to pop up it's hints when it decides.

<h3>Programming, windows style</h3>
I'm now in the thick of a bunch of win32 programming at my Honeywell part-time job.  I don't mind it that much, but I continue to be amazed that Microsoft's IDE is still the one used most often.  The autocompletion is nice, but that's about the only good thing about it.  I am continually annoyed that the IDE doesn't know which definition of a function I want to use, and only seems to pop up it's hints when it decides.  Add this to the fact that most win32 libraries aren't apparently setup in a way so you can put their source in the repository, and I have a lot of admin work which I'm not particularly thrilled to do.   10% programming, 90% random crap.  I'm beginning to understand why the average lines of code per day is so low.  I can't really complain that much though, I knew the tools we'd be using when I accepted the job.
<h3>Programming, rails style</h3>
I have been working with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> lately, mostly to make some new web applications which aren't released yet.  Things which are possibly in the works:
<ul>
	<li> MoneyDelta - credit card and savings balance tracker - figures out how much money you are making (or losing) each day based on how the interest is actually calculated. In the end it will probably have a little graph and possibly small things you can do in order to avoid interest and how much you would save in the long run.</li>
	<li> DeadSimpleCMS - CMS built mostly for <a href="http://ceilingsarecool.livejournal.com">Diana</a>'s use.  It lets you specify layouts (not done yet) and content which goes into the layouts.  In a very very early stage of development, but it is actually live on a site right now.  As the name would imply, the point is to be very simple.</li>
	<li> Gathr - scholarly conference management software.  Accepts papers, assigns reviewers based on degrees of connection to avoid conflicts of interest, generally tries to make the whole conference thing easier.</li>
</ul>
I also have a couple of smaller applications which won't really go anywhere, and an internal application upgrade from php.  I really enjoy building web applications in the Rails framework, and I have honed my skills at Ruby enough that I actually use it for small scripts when I get frustrated with bash.  I tend to do my Ruby Coding in <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> and with <a href="http://locomotive.raaum.org/">Locomotive</a> on the iBook, although I may do some on the Debian machine soon.
