title: "Big Bang Theory Intro #2: Magnified Roundworms"

  The image in question comes from <a href="http://www.jupiterimages.com/popup2.aspx?navigationSubType=itemdetails&related=n&itemID=23373203">Jupiter Images</a> stock photography, and is labelled as "Ascaris bivalent mitosis magnified 200x".  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris">Ascaris</a> is a roundworm, which can infect pigs or humans.  It lives in the small intestines and produces lots of eggs.  This reminds me of an episode of the Soup where they had some stupid reality show doctor clip about getting tapeworms because of bad sanitation, which is where you would get these.   Ascaris lumbricoides is the most common worm infection, affecting more than a billion people. 
  
  Just one more reason for me to wash my hands.
