title: Birthdays and non-events.
excerpt: |-
  This is just a short note to remind everyone that the most wonderful woman in the world deserves birthday greetings.  She's still only 4 years, 5 months, and 2 days older than me, and not 5 years older, which she would like you to believe.  Despite that, she easily is beautiful enough to be younger than me, and I'm blessed that she can tolerate my ineptitude.
  
  Happy birthday [lj user="ceilingsarecool"]!
