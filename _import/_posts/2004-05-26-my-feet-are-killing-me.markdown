Well, today I was hoping to get a new license, my first Minnesotan one. Di and I walked to downtown, where she had some stuff to do.  We walked downtown and when we got to Block E we took the skyways.  We stopped and browsed around Barnes &amp; Noble for a while and then walked the skyways to the Hennepin county government building downtown.

It was there, in a huge government building in the heart of a large metropolitan area, that I found out that I need a birth certificate in order to prove that I exist or something, and I need to go to one of the suburbs in order to take the written test.  I find it slightly
strange that I can't get it done in a large building downtown.  I also find it annoying that they can't trust that Iowa verified my existence/identity correctly when they gave me my license.

After that ordeal, we had been walking a while so we went through the skyways back to Block E and had some ice cream from Coldstone Creamery and I had a pretzel.   We discovered that if we were more astute earlier, we could have seen Harry Potter at a special showing at the theater there. Then we took the streets to the post office, where I finally mailed my copy of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/">This is Spinal Tap</a> to someone who wanted it for $10.

All in all, it was a LOT of walking, so my feet hurt now, and I'm resting.  I didn't go into work today and feel kindof bad about that, except that I found out that nothing would have been done by me except a couple of useless phone calls anyway.   I'm going to sit down and watch some TV now and rest.
