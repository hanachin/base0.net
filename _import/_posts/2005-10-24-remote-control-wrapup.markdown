Recently in the States a new season of TV shows started - okay, so it was 3 or 4 weeks ago, but I haven't gotten around to writing about it until now.  In preparation for the new seasons, I reactivated the ReplayTV, which makes it much easier and less stressful to catch all the shows.  Some of the shows were basically dead in the water before I even caught one glimpse.  Most of the shows that I'm watching this time around is just more seasons of the same while picking a couple new shows mostly for actors.   (Show list below the fold)

Current shows on the Replay:
<ul>
	<li> CSI:, <span class="caps">CSI</span>: Miami, <span class="caps">CSI</span>: NY</li>
	<li>How I Met Your Mother</li>
	<li>Kitchen Confidential</li>
	<li>Jeopardy!</li>
	<li>Gilmore Girls</li>
	<li>Supernatural</li>
	<li>Bones</li>
	<li>Numb3rs</li>
</ul>
I've watched a few other shows this season, but they didn't really grab me as good.  Not that the ones above are good, but they are nice to relax to when I end my workday.  Another new development in leisure is a new <a href="http://www.ofausa.com/remote.php?type=URC6131n">
remote control</a> - I lost the old one and decided that we could use one that can control everything we have.  I'm very happy with not having more than one control for all of our stuff.
