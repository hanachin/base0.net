title: Bad attempt at a do-no-work day
excerpt: It being friday, I attempted to make today a do-no-work day, as I try to make all fridays.  It gets hard when I have office hours scheduled.   A lot of students yesterday didn't finish the lab (in fact, no one did, that I know of) and that means busy office hours on Monday at least, and it meant a bunch of questions today.  This is the gut-check lab for most of them I think.

It being friday, I attempted to make today a do-no-work day, as I try to make all fridays.  It gets hard when I have office hours scheduled.   A lot of students yesterday didn't finish the lab (in fact, no one did, that I know of) and that means busy office hours on Monday at least, and it meant a bunch of questions today.  This is the gut-check lab for most of them I think.  It's hard enough that if you don't get off your ass and do something, you aren't going to do well in the class.

Do-no-work day be damned, I remembered an assignment that was due today (and I didn't do earlier) that I had to finish, so I had to do actual work around 6pm today after supper at Sallys with <a href="http://silvrayn.livejournal.com">silvrayn</a>, the non-posting <a href="http://want_a_be.livejournal.com">want_a_be</a> and the rest of the gang from the lab.  I swear that Sally's buffalo chicken wrap is awesome for stomachs that have had only junk food.  I finished my homework and attempted to do more actual work (now that I had blown the whole no-work thing) and ended up playing a lot of <a href="http://aluminumangel.org/attack/">Crack Attack</a> with some people who are trying to finish a long homework.   That game is seriously addictive.

I also discovered that it is impossible to embed <a href="http://www.ijg.org/">libjpeg</a> into a reasonable C++ object.  I now need to find a C++ library for jpeg, or continue to compress frames from a robot in the old way, which I think is hacked and sucks.   I really need to get the new interface working.  It's probably more important at this point than the server with heartbeat that I am writing, and the server which I thought would be a major change is turning out to be (mostly) a retyping of the old server, with small improvements.  I'll probably give up and start on the client end again next week sometime.  This would require me to dive back into <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/geeklog/index.php">Linux on the IPAQ</a> again, which was fun for a time.

At least this weekend seems full, because I get to do something nice for someone on valentine's, and as an added bonus, I'm going to a party on sunday!  Yay!  Okay, time to play more crack attack, and maybe get some reading for work done.
